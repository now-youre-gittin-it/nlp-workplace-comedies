COLD OPEN
INT. SOME KIND OF CRAMPED OFFICE - MORNING 
A 31-year-old woman, MIRA, in smudged makeup and a crumpled 
cocktail dress, sits in a chair. She speaks to someone off 
camera who we cannot see. 
MIRA
You have an idea of how your life 
is going to work out. When I was a 
kid, all I did was watch romantic 
comedies in our living room while I 
did my homework.  
INT. LIVING ROOM OF A INDIAN-AMERICAN FAMILY’S HOUSE - 1988
A 7-year-old Mira does flashcards while she watches the Meg 
Ryan diner scene in When Harry Met Sally. An old INDIAN 
GRANDMOTHER sleeps in a chair nearby. 
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD MIRA
I’ll have what she’s having.  
INT. SAME LIVING ROOM AS BEFORE - 1995
A 16-year-old Mira studies with piles of textbooks. She’s now 
watching Four Weddings and a Funeral. 
HUGH GRANT
Would you be interested in, 
perhaps, spending the rest of your 
life not married to me?
ANDIE MCDOWELL MIRA
I do. I do. 
MIRA (V.O.)
In college I had less time to watch 
movies... 
EXT. DORM BUILDING - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT - 2002
We pan up the side of a brick dorm at Princeton University, 
seeing young couples hooking up in different rooms. We land 
on the window of a now 20-year-old Mira, sitting on her dorm 
room bed, with piles of biology textbooks in front of her, 
studying. She’s also watching You’ve Got Mail. 
MEG RYAN MIRA
I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be you.

Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  2.
Mira’s roommate and best friend GWEN, walks into the room and 
tosses her a box of Pop Tarts which Mira catches without 
looking. 
GWEN
Have you showered this week?
Mira shakes her head solemnly, transfixed by the movie.  
MIRA (V.O.)
And then, eventually, I had no time 
at all. 
INT. MANHATTAN HOSPITAL - NIGHT - 2010
Mira, now 30, an intern at a hospital, in a doctors coat and 
scrubs, stands with a group of other eager student-doctors. 
MIRA (V.O.)
But romantic comedies had done 
their damage. 
One is JEREMY REED, 30, super hot and pretty, and total bad 
news in a Bradley Cooper kind of way. Another is CLAYTON 
BROOKS, 30, not too shabby-looking himself, but serious and 
disdainful. To be honest, he’s kind of a dick. These are our 
guys. 
There are few others, led by a distinguished doctor, MARC 
SHULMAN, who has a yarmulke and a Brooklyn accent. He talks 
to a PREGNANT PATIENT and her HUSBAND.  
DR. SHULMAN
You’re eight and a half months 
pregnant, your husband’s gotta keep 
his schvantz away from you. 
JEREMY
Which I can imagine is hard with a 
wife as beautiful as yours. 
The patient enjoys this. Brooks rolls his eyes. Jeremy smiles 
at them, and then glances at Mira and winks at her. Mira 
reacts: holy shit, did that happen?
DR. SHULMAN
She’s already pregnant, Dr. Reed. 
(to the couple)
I’m putting Dr. Brooks in charge of 
you. He’s my best student. 
The students grumble while Brooks steps forward with an 
imperious smile. 

4
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  3.
BROOKS
(intense)
Clayton Brooks. I am determined to 
give you and your unborn baby the 
most focused and unwavering care.  
Now it’s Jeremy’s turn to roll his eyes. 
MIRA (V.O.)
That’s when I saw him. 
We move past Brooks to outside of the room, where we see a 
MOST APPEALING GUY, a doctor, reading a newspaper. This guy 
looks like he walked out of a Nora Ephron movie. Floppy hair, 
dimples, the works. 
MIRA
(to herself)
Hello.  
INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
Mira is in the elevator. The doors begin to close when--
MOST APPEALING GUY
Hold the door!
It’s the guy. He walks into the elevator. 
MIRA
It’s you. 
MOST APPEALING GUY
What?
MIRA
Achoo. Just a cute little sneeze. 
What floor?
MOST APPEALING GUY
Same as yours. 
He smiles warmly at her, then accidentally drops his thermos 
and newspaper. Mira gets down to help him and her folders 
slip out of her hands. They start picking up all their stuff. 
TOM
Klutzes? Party of two. 
Mira’s hair - tied up in a bun - comes undone. She can’t 
believe it. 
MIRA (V.O.)
An elevator? Our stuff fell out of 
our hands? My hair came undone? 
(MORE)

5
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  4.
MIRA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Holy crap, I’m basically Sandra 
Bullock. But then it happened. The 
omen. Er, omen sounds bad. What’s a 
good omen called? Oh, whatever. 
The elevator jerks to a stop and the lights flicker. 
MOST APPEALING GUY
Did the elevator just stop?
Mira closes her eyes. It all led up to this. It’s happening.
MIRA
I’m Mira. Obstetrics and 
gynecology.
MOST APPEALING GUY
Tom. Orthodonist. 
They shake hands, both somehow aware of what all this means.
MIRA (V.O.)
We were stuck in the elevator 
twenty minutes and I moved into his 
apartment two months later. 
VOICE (V.O.)
(thick Caribbean accent)
Ma’am. What does dis have to do 
with you stealing ja bike, driving 
ja bike while intoxicated, then 
trespassing in ja swimming pool?
INT. POLICE PRECINCT - PRESENT DAY
A un-smiling FEMALE POLICE OFFICER sits across from Mira in a 
precinct room. We see Mira has been telling her story here.
MIRA
Tom got married last night. To 
someone else. Some Serbian girl who 
sells bagels in the lobby of the 
hospital. 
INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MORNING
We see a beautiful SERBIAN GIRL handing Tom a bagel and 
coffee in the lobby of the hospital. 
SERBIAN GIRL
One tall latte vith extra cream no 
sugar. 
She smiles. She has horrible teeth. Tom smiles back, 
enchanted. Off her teeth we dissolve to: 

6
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  5.
EXT. WEDDING TENT - NIGHT
We now see Serbian girl smiling under a tent at a posh post-
wedding dinner reception. She smiles. Perfect teeth.  
MIRA (V.O.)
He dumped me, she moved in, he 
fixed her teeth. They got married 
last night. I don’t think they 
thought I would actually go, so 
they invited me. But I did go. 
We now see Mira, in her dress, sitting at a table with 
various old people and foreigners. 
MIRA (V.O.)
I was at the worst table - the 
Randoms. You know, where the old 
babysitters and childhood pen pals 
sit?
Mira and an OLD HIPPIE LADY get wasted and are laughing 
loudly.
MIRA (V.O.)
So, me and Tom’s old babysitter 
Bernice got wasted together. 
BERNICE
Why would Tom break up with a 
thoughtful girl like you?
MIRA
He wanted kids. 
BERNICE
You don’t want kids?
MIRA
No, he wanted kids. Six of ‘em. He 
thought I was too old for that. 
BERNICE
Six kids? What is he, in a cult?
(confiding)
He wet the bed until he was 10. 
MIRA (V.O.)
And then, I felt like making a 
speech. 
Mira is now at the microphone.  

7
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  6.
MIRA
Some of you may know Tom and I used 
to date. So I have some pretty good 
stories of everyone’s favorite 
glorified dentist.  
People laugh with anticipation, including Tom and the bride. 
We see Clayton, Dr. Shulman and his wife, and Jeremy are 
there. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
Like the time he thought he had 
Lyme disease but it turned out to 
be a patch of dry skin on his 
stomach. 
People laugh. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
Or how he always says “Oh, Larry” 
when we watch Curb Your Enthusiasm, 
like he has a personal relationship 
with Larry David. 
People love this. Brooks whispers to Dr. Shulman. 
BROOKS
What’s Curb Your Enthusiasm?
DR. SHULMAN
Oy vey. 
MIRA
Or the time he told me during sex 
that he wanted to marry me and make 
me pregnant with six babies. 
People stop smiling. Brooks covers his eyes. Jeremy loves 
this.
MIRA (CONT’D)
Which I really wanted too. But, 
well, that didn’t end up happening. 
Obviously. Cuz here I am, sitting 
with a bunch of randoms at his 
wedding to the Serbian bagel girl. 
(whispering)
By the way, are we a hundred 
percent sure she’s not a war 
criminal? 
(then, off their reaction)
Oh, get over yourselves. Like the 
thought didn’t cross your mind. 
(MORE)

8
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  7.
MIRA (CONT’D)
So: to Tom and Bagel Girl. May you 
never run out of bagels.  
Mira throws her wine glass down, shattering it. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
L’Chaim! Peace. I’m out. Tom wet 
the bed until he was ten!
(Mr. T.)
Huhn! 
Mira leaves the stage, grabs a bottle of champagne from a 
waiter’s tray, walks out of the tent past the caterers, grabs 
a bike, and begins to pedal and drink at the same time. She 
bikes off.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Mira is biking, wasted, and drinking in a residential area. 
MIRA
I’m Kate Hudson. I’m Kate Hudson.
She runs a red light, and narrowly misses a car. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
Racist! 
Mira careens into the driveway of a house. She looks at it. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
Tudor. Nice. 
She speeds through the driveway and does not notice the bike 
is riding straight toward a swimming pool. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
Oh shi--
She can’t stop and falls into the pool. Underwater, Mira 
opens her eyes. She notices a Minnie Mouse toy at the bottom 
of the pool. It is frowning at her.
MINNIE MOUSE
(with contempt)
Loser. Thirty-one year old loser. 
MIRA
(subtitled)
Who the hell do you think you are, 
you little bitch?
MINNIE MOUSE
At least I have a boyfriend. 

9
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  8.
MIRA (V.O.)
And when Minnie Mouse pointed out 
that even she had a long-term 
boyfriend, I just started to cry. 
Mira is now crying underwater somehow. It’s pitiful. 
MIRA (V.O.)
This is not where I thought I’d be. 
END COLD OPEN

Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  9.
ACT ONE
INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS
Mira continues to be questioned at the police station. 
MIRA
I got fished out by the people who 
own the house, who were actually 
not that nice. They called you and 
here I am. 
OFFICER #2
We have you down for two counts of 
public intoxication, theft, and 
disorderly conduct. 
MIRA
I’m getting the third degree 
because of freaking disorderly 
conduct? Aren’t there rapists and 
murderers out there? 
CARIBBEAN OFFICER #1
When you’re disorderly you’re a 
rapist of peace and quiet.  
MIRA
Okay, look. 
(demure)
Did I mention that I’m a doctor?  
An OBGYN? I bring life into this 
world.  
CARIBBEAN OFFICER #1
So what?
MIRA *
Do you guys need free birth 
control?
They consider this. Another officer enters. 
OFFICER #3
She’s been bailed out.
OFFICER #2
We’re not even finished questioning 
her.
OFFICER #3
She’s being bailed out by the 
governor’s daughter. 
Mira smiles. 

11
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  10.
MIRA
It’s been great working with you 
guys and seeing this process from *
the inside. 
INT. POLICE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
Gwen is there. Gwen is now an impeccably-dressed beauty, 
rocking motherhood Gwyneth Paltrow-style. Mira hugs her. 
MIRA
I love you so much. 
GWEN
I don’t love you at all. *
MIRA *
I have enough love for the both of *
us, you political royalty, you. *
GWEN *
I can’t keep using my mom for this *
stuff. I’m already using her to get *
Sophie into private school. Get in *
the car, I’m late to drop Sophie 
off to hip-hop and get filler 
injected in my nasolabial folds.   
Mira stops Gwen. *
MIRA
Tell me the truth. How bad is it?
GWEN
It’s on Facebook, but it hasn’t 
been re-mixed into a song yet. 
Gwen hands Mira her phone. Mira watches a recording of her 
toast. 
MIRA (O.C.)
“Are we a hundred percent sure 
she’s not a war criminal?”
MIRA (CONT’D)
Wow. I went to genocide. 
GWEN
You looked pretty, though. 
MIRA
Yeah, my hair’s not bad. Who shot 
this? Why did they leave all this 
space to the left of me? Know how 
to center, much? 

12
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  11.
GWEN
You’re right. That’s the takeaway. 
INT. GWEN’S MERCEDES SUV - CONTINUOUS
SOPHIE, Gwen’s 6-year-old daughter, is in the back seat. 
MIRA
I’ll never give you crap for being 
a housewife again. I don’t know how 
to repay you. 
GWEN
I’m not a housewife. I’m an 
attorney that has taken an 
indefinite amount of time off to 
raise my daughter. Everyone put 
your seat belts on. 
SOPHIE
Mine was on the whole time. 
GWEN
Good girl. 
(to Mira)
I know how you can repay me. You 
could hit me up with some wink-wink 
in my nasolabial folds. 
MIRA
I don’t do wink-wink.  I do pap 
smears.  You need a plastic 
surgeon.
Gwen pulls out of the parking lot. 
GWEN
I just feel like our relationship 
isn’t reciprocal.
MIRA
Uh, I protect you from yourself. 
You’d look like Bruce Jenner if it 
wasn’t for me. 
SOPHIE
What’s a pap smear? What’s wink-
wink?
GWEN
Nothing sweetheart. It’s adult 
stuff, like taxes. 
(then, to Mira)
(MORE)

13
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  12.
GWEN (CONT'D)
I want to tell you this, because I 
am picking you up from a police 
precinct and I think it’s timely. 
You need to pull it together. *
MIRA *
I know. *
(gesturing to self) *
This person? This drunk, crime- *
committing person? She’s history. *
There is no reason for me to live *
my life like this. I went to a good *
college. I’m a successful doctor. *
My body mass index could be better *
but I’m not like, Precious or *
anything.  This is my year.  *
(then, empowered) *
Do you have a multi-vitamin? I feel *
like taking one. *
GWEN *
You have that date tonight with *
Dennis. Carl worked really hard to *
sell you at his firm. *
MIRA *
I am so psyched for this date. A *
real date. Not hooking up with a *
guy at the end of a party. Not *
sleeping with Jeremy because he has *
that insane, Biblical-quality hair, *
and then the next day I’m all: *
(cool detached voice) *
“By the way, what’s our deal, *
anyway?”. *
GWEN *
You do that? That’s horrifying. *
SOPHIE *
This is boring. *
MIRA *
You’re boring. Contribute *
something. *
Mira rummages through a small cooler and begins to eat. *
SOPHIE
That’s my lunch! *
MIRA
You seriously get a bento box for *
lunch? *

14
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  13.
SOPHIE
(freaking out)
Don’t eat it! It’s mine! Its mine! *
MIRA
You’re spoiled! I’m helping you 
build character! 
Mira gets a loud page on her pager. 
SOPHIE
What’s that? *
MIRA
My pager. Oh my god. My patient’s 
in labor. 
SOPHIE
(with disdain)
Who has pagers? *
MIRA
Uh, important people like drug 
dealers and big shot doctors like 
me. 
(to Gwen)
We gotta haul ass to St. E’s. I 
have four patients and three don’t 
speak English or have any health 
insurance. But this one does: 
Alison Silverman. White. From Glen 
Ridge, New Jersey. Cha-ching. 
GWEN
Can you go there looking like this?
MIRA
I work hard, I play hard.  
GWEN
You look like Carrie. 
MIRA
Bradshaw?
GWEN
Stephen King. 
MIRA
Dammit. Left here! 
Gwen takes a hard left. Mira’s beeper goes off again. *

15
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  14.
MIRA (CONT’D)
Why aren’t we moving? Gwen, I 
specifically told you to haul ass.
There is bumper to bumper traffic for blocks. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
I can’t lose this delivery. See you *
guys!
GWEN
Where are you--?
Too late. Mira is off. 
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MORNING
Mira is booking it down the street in her cocktail dress and 
heels. She stops, yanks off her heels, and continues to run. 
EXT. ST. ELIZABETH’S MEDICAL CENTER - MORNING
Mira runs in past people. They stare at her. *
MIRA *
Excuse me! I’m saving a life! Get *
out of my way! *
INT. ELEVATOR BAY - CONTINUOUS *
Mira’s in the elevator. The doors are closing. *
MIRA *
(impatient) *
Come on, come on! *
The doors are closing when an extremely ancient DIALYSIS *
PATIENT sticks his cane in the elevator. He’s in wheelchair *
and has a bored TEENAGE ATTENDANT listening to headphones. *
OLD MAN *
Dialysis, please. *
MIRA *
Sure. *
She pushes the button, hiding a sigh. *
OLD MAN *
I was stationed in India in the *
50’s. Beautiful country. *
MIRA *
So I hear. Never been. *

16
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  15.
OLD MAN *
And such beautiful women. Are you *
married? *
MIRA *
I’m sorry, I have to ask, just for *
my own feeling of self-worth. Are *
you asking because you’re thinking *
“I’m a really old man, I might as *
well reach for the stars and ask *
this girl out?” or because you *
think it is plausible, based on our *
appearances, that we could be a *
viable couple? *
OLD MAN *
The latter. *
MIRA *
I am going to kill myself. *
The door opens. Mira runs out to Labor & Delivery. *
INT. HOSPITAL - LABOR AND DELIVERY
Mira runs in, feet dirty, still in her cocktail dress, 
looking wretched, panting. An O.R. Nurse, MARILYN, sees her. *
MIRA *
Tell me good news, Marilyn. *
MARILYN
Her contractions were too close. I *
had to call the doctor on call.
Mira runs by a delivery room, and sees Brooks handing Mrs. 
Silverman her baby. Brooks walks out, taking off his gloves *
and mask. 
MIRA
(crestfallen)
You delivered my patient. 
BROOKS
You’re welcome. 
Brooks looks Mira up and down with disdain. 
BROOKS (CONT’D)
What prom did you just give birth *
at? *
MIRA
I was right here. 

17
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  16.
BROOKS
I promise, I tried reasoning with 
the baby, telling him that the real 
doctor was sobering up on the floor 
of a jail cell, but he just didn’t 
seem to care.  
MIRA
You did not go there. *
BROOKS
It’s impossible not to go there. *
Also, Mrs. Silverman asked if I *
would be her doctor from now on and 
I said yes.
Mira reacts. Brooks ducks into the doctors’ lounge. *
INT. DOCTORS’ LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
MIRA
You’re stealing my patient? *
BROOKS
It’s not stealing if she wanted to 
go. 
(then, surprised and 
revolted)
Jesus! What are you doing? 
Mira holds a large clump of her hair in her hand. 
MIRA
I’m taking out my hair extensions. *
God, you are so sheltered. *
BROOKS
We are not two members of the same *
R&B girls group. That is *
disturbing. Pull yourself together. *
I can see your undergarment. 
Mira looks down. Her strapless bra is peeking out a good two 
inches of her dress. She shoves it down, mortified. 
JEREMY (O.C.)
It’s called a bra, Brooks. Or, have 
you never seen one before?
Jeremy is lounging on the sofa, reading a magazine. *

18
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  17.
JEREMY (CONT’D)
It hooks around a woman’s back, and 
kind of lifts and supports the 
breasts--
Jeremy mimes a woman’s breasts with his hands. 
JEREMY (CONT’D) *
--And they’re very fun to take off. 
I recommend it someday. Come here, 
Mira. Keep me company.
Jeremy pats the space next to him on the sofa. Mira sits next 
to him. Brooks gets an apple from the vending machine. 
BROOKS
What a beautiful picture: the 
alcoholic and the sex addict.
JEREMY
(hurt)
That is not fair. Yes, I love sex. 
And I do it a lot. But I’m not 
addicted to it. I’m addicted to 
attention, which manifests itself 
in frequent sexual encounters. 
MIRA BROOKS
That’s really interesting. (disgusted)
Oh, God. 
JEREMY (CONT’D)
Is it so wrong that I became an 
OBGYN because woman’s sexuality is 
the thing I love the most in the 
world?
MIRA BROOKS
Not at all.  That’s noble. Yes, of course it is.
JEREMY (CONT’D)
I don’t need to explain myself to 
you. 
BROOKS
But one day you might, to a judge. *
Brooks turns to leave. *

19
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  18.
BROOKS (CONT’D) *
I also want to add it’s extremely *
annoying I can’t read the newspaper *
in here because Dr. Reed has turned *
the doctor’s lounge into a place of *
tawdry sexuality.  *
He leaves in a huff. Jeremy gets up. *
JEREMY *
I have no idea what he is talking *
about. *
Jeremy dims the lights to exactly doing-it level. He comes *
back to the sofa. *
JEREMY (CONT’D)
(turned on)
You look so trashy right now. Wanna *
hang out? *
MIRA
We are hanging out. *
JEREMY *
Like hang out, deep? *
MIRA *
Thanks for the offer, but...I *
actually should be heading back to *
the office. *
Mira hops up. *
MIRA (CONT’D) *
See you there? *
JEREMY *
(slightly shocked) *
Sure. Cool. *
MIRA *
Cool. *
Mira leaves, super impressed with herself. *
END OF ACT ONE

Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  19.
ACT TWO
INT. OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING *
We see the door of a medical office, it says: Shulman Womens *
Health Associates: Shulman, Brooks, Reed & Kaviraya, OBGYNs *
INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS *
There is a central reception area, and four doors around it *
with individual doctor’s offices. By each office are chairs *
and chic, well-dressed patients. Except Mira’s.  *
Mira’s area is messy and trying to do too much, kind of like *
Mira. It’s mismatched chairs, a Bob Marley poster on the *
wall, and ethnic tapestries. There are two patients there - *
an ancient sleeping lady and a Mexican woman in a poncho 
knitting. At the central reception desk, a girl, BETSY, built *
like a linebacker (female Chris Farley), reads the newspaper 
and sits next to a delicate looking young man, ERIC (Chris 
Colfer with no singing ability). These are Shulman Associates *
receptionists. 
Betsy shrieks. 
ERIC
What? What is it?
BETSY
I’m sorry. I thought that raisin 
was a bug.  
We see a single stray raisin on the desk between them. She 
reaches over and pops it in her mouth. Eric is disgusted. 
BETSY (CONT’D)
What? I know it’s not a bug. 
ERIC
But were you sure it was a raisin?
Mira enters, takes a deep breath, and walks up to the main *
reception desk. *
MIRA
Guys, I don’t know how else to put *
this: I spent the night in jail. *
ERIC *
Yeah, we saw it on youtube. *
BETSY *
They did a mash-up of it with Ke$ha *
song. It was hilarious.   *

21
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  20.
MIRA *
That was fast. Okay, well, I’m glad *
it happened, in a way. Because now: *
fresh start. New me. Guys, it has *
come to my attention that my part *
of the office looks more like a *
marijuana dispensary than a 
successful doctor’s office. Who is *
in charge of decorating?
ERIC
That wasn’t a job you really 
designated to anyone. 
MIRA
I need my section of this office to *
not look like Port Authority. *
BETSY
I’m so sorry we let you down, Mira. 
MIRA
Just, let’s try to fix this. 
BETSY
And to do this on the day of your *
big date? It’s unforgivable. 
Betsy hurls her magazine in anger. *
BETSY (CONT’D)
Betsy, how could you be so stupid?! *
MIRA
Well, don’t get over-upset.   
BETSY *
Stupid! Stupid! *
MIRA *
Okay. Stop. Stop. I forgive you. *
BETSY *
You’re so merciful. *
MIRA
Let’s change subjects. Tonight. Hot 
Date. Real date. I am not *
available. Even if Taylor Swift 
herself is delivering triplets. No *
interruptions. 

22
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  21.
BETSY
We should definitely talk about 
this, but you have a new patient 
and she’s waiting in your office.  
MIRA
(excited)
Oh hell yes. *
Mira goes to enter her office. 
ERIC
May I suggest you put on your lab 
coat? You look like your own mug 
shot. 
MIRA
Yikes. Hit me up. 
Mira throws on her lab coat, Eric and Betsy spruce her up by 
running a comb through her hair and removing lint - they do 
this a lot. Mira goes in. 
INT. MIRA’S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
We see NASREEN,a very pregnant woman in a hijab, accompanied 
by her 10-year-old son, MAX.  Mira looks through her chart, 
disappointed. 
MIRA
So Nasreen, you are eight and a 
half months pregnant with your 
second child. Your husband died six 
months ago and you was covered 
under his health insurance, leaving 
you... with no coverage. 
Max translates. Nasreen says: “That is correct.” 
MIRA (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, we have a policy. 
Mira points to a sign on the wall with an illustration of 
Hagar the Horrible saying: “No health insurance, no care.” 
Max translates back. 
MAX
Do you think you could make an 
exception?
MIRA
It’s just that if I treat you, then 
others will use this as a 
precedent. 

23
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  22.
Max translates. 
MAX *
We won’t tell anyone. 
MIRA
Still, they could find out. 
MAX
How?
MIRA
I might say something. It might 
slip out by the watercooler. In my 
sleep. I can’t control it. 
A confused Max begins to translate this. He’s miming a water 
cooler. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
Okay, fine. I’ll take you on as a 
patient. But I am really not 
psyched about this. You need to 
promise me you’ll get insurance. 
And don’t mention this to anyone.
Max translates and Nasreen is excited. 
MAX
Thank you so much. 
MIRA
You’re welcome. I better be the 
godmother to this freaking kid. 
Nasreen, come with me. 
Max gets up. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
Max, you can stay here. 
MAX
What if she needs me?
MIRA
We’ll be fine. 
(off his worried look)
Here, play with my phone. But don’t 
download anything. 
INT. RECEPTION AREA - A LITTLE LATER
Nasreen and Max leave. Mira stands at the door. 

24
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  23.
MIRA
Bye guys! Hope you find the bus 
stop okay! *
They leave. Mira turns to Betsy and Eric. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
What the hell, you guys? A non-
English-speaking, 8 months pregnant 
widow with no health insurance?! *
BETSY *
I couldn’t turn her away. 
MIRA
Yes, you could’ve. I admire that *
you guys want to help the needy, 
but this office is not an 
inflatable raft. I give plenty to 
charity, I’m doing a noble 
profession, and frankly, I have my 
own problems, okay? I am hooked on 
expensive hair products the way a 
heroin addict is hooked on drugs. I 
just can’t take any more patients 
who can’t pay or don’t have health 
insurance. I want patients like *
those guys. *
Mira gestures to the white patients sitting in the other *
doctor’s areas. Betsy takes notes on a pad. *
BETSY *
More white patients. Done. *
MIRA *
Well, don’t write that. *
(whispers) *
But yes. *
(then, to Eric) *
Give me my date outfit. I want to *
try it on. *
Eric hands her a bag of clothes. *
ERIC *
I resent that you made me buy your *
clothes. Just because I’m gay *
doesn’t mean I like shopping for *
womens clothes. *

25
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  24.
INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER *
Brooks is now there, picking up some paperwork. Mira steps *
out, wearing wedge boots, leggings, an over-sized and a chic *
over-sized sweater, chunky necklace. *
MIRA *
Well? *
BETSY *
You look amazing. *
MIRA *
Thanks. I wanted to wear sequins *
but Gwen says it looks like I’m *
going to a quinceañera. *
Brooks makes a noise of disapproval. *
MIRA (CONT’D) *
I can hear you, making little *
sounds. What? *
BROOKS *
That is not a good date outfit. *
MIRA *
What do you mean? It’s fashion-y *
and fabulous. *
BROOKS *
Bag lady sweater? Those boots that *
look live hooves? Chunky necklace? *
Girls like that stuff but guys hate *
it. *
MIRA *
Uhh, I’m pretty sure guys like *
this. *
BROOKS *
I repeat: Unless your date is with *
an middle-aged lesbian, that is not *
a good date outfit. *
ERIC *
(smitten) *
That’s hilarious. *
MIRA *
No, it’s not hilarious, Eric. It’s *
offensive. I’m offended on behalf *
of gay people. *

26
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  25.
ERIC *
I’m gay and I loved it. *
MIRA *
Shut up, Eric. Other, smarter, gay *
people. *
BROOKS *
Just my two cents. But what do I *
know? I’m just a wealthy, single, *
heterosexual white male.  *
ERIC *
(into it) *
Yeah, you are. *
BETSY *
Well, what do you think she should *
wear? *
BROOKS *
Easy. Tight dress. High heels. *
MIRA *
Great. Clayton Brooks, everyone, *
the most boring, predictable man on *
the planet.  *
BROOKS *
Okay, fine. You know what would *
really look best? If you lost *
fifteen pounds. *
Mira’s mouth drops open. *
MIRA *
You want to get smacked, son? *
A few patients look up, concerned. *
BROOKS *
(loudly) *
No, Dr. Kaviraya, I don’t want to *
get smacked in my place of work. I *
want to peacefully go about my day. *
The patients shoot Mira dirty looks.  *
BROOKS (CONT’D) *
(whispering) *
And maybe invest in a padded bra. *
Brooks walks away, triumphant. Mira is speechless. We hear a *
beep. It’s her phone. *

27
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  26.
It says: “I think you look hot.” She looks up. Jeremy is in *
his doorway, smiling at her. She smiles back. *
INT. JEREMY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Mira and Jeremy make out on the floor of his exam room.  *
MIRA
You smell like peaches. 
JEREMY
You smell like chlorine and vomit. 
MIRA
I’m so sorry.  
JEREMY
No, it makes it more wrong. I love 
it. 
Mira runs her fingers through Jeremy’s hair. 
MIRA
God, your hair is so thick. It’s 
like a tar pit. *
Jeremy starts to push up her skirt. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
No wait. Stop. We can’t. I told *
myself I wouldn’t. *
JEREMY *
Let’s just worry about that later. *
MIRA
We wouldn’t worry about it. Only I 
would. *
Mira dis-entangles herself. *
MIRA (CONT’D)
I should be using my thirties to 
try to find a real boyfriend. 
Because someday I’d like to have a 
real husband. And some actual kids. 
My friends all got married in their 
20s when I was becoming a doctor. 
So I can’t spend the next ten years 
fooling around with colleagues even *
if they look like a mannequin that *
came to life. *

28
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  27.
JEREMY *
That would make a great blog entry. *
I kind of just want to get naked *
right now.  *
MIRA *
Look, I can still be your hook-up 
buddy in my forties, fifties, and 
sixties. 
JEREMY
I won’t want to have sex with you 
in your forties, fifties, and 
sixties.  
MIRA
Sorry. I want to, but I can’t. *
Mira turns to leave. She then impulsively kisses him. *
MIRA (CONT’D) *
I think that’s a good compromise. *
Addicts can’t go cold turkey. It *
doesn’t work.  *
She kisses him again. *
MIRA (CONT’D) *
Okay, that was too much. *
Mira leaves. Jeremy is a little impressed at her restraint. *
INT. HALLWAY - LATER *
Mira walks, now on the phone. She’s in tight dress and high *
heels and her coat, on her way out. *
GWEN (O.C.)
You’re lying. *
MIRA
I didn’t! Mostly because I’m *
wearing Spanx. But no, I didn’t. *
GWEN (O.C.)
That’s my girl. He’s ridiculous *
looking, though. I don’t think I *
would’ve been able to stop. 
(to someone off-camera)
Sophie don’t use that kid’s 
inhaler. You don’t have asthma. *
(then, to Mira) *
You’re not wearing sequins, right? *
Sequins are for earnest sluts. *

29
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  28.
MIRA *
I disagree with that, but no, I’m *
not. *
(quietly) *
Tight dress, high heels. *
GWEN *
That’s perfect, Mir! *
Mira hits the elevator button. 
MIRA
I think it’s lateral, but whatever. *
I’m so excited to meet Dennis. Eric *
printed out a picture of him from *
Facebook. It’s super tiny because *
all Eric’s friends are gay tweakers *
and have no degrees of friends *
close to him. But he looks good. *
Mira squints at a print out of a tiny pixillated picture. *
MIRA (CONT’D) *
I think I love Dennis. Is that 
possible? 
GWEN
No. That’s weird. You have not met 
or spoken to him.  
MIRA
It seriously feels like love 
though. 
GWEN (O.C.)
Mira, I didn’t want to tell you 
this to freak you out, but Dennis 
is an analyst... for Beyonce 
Knowles.
The elevator opens. 
MIRA
You think you have to use her last 
name?! Oh. My. God. 
(to the people in the 
elevator)
Go. Go! I’m obviously not getting 
on. 
END OF ACT TWO

Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  29.
ACT THREE
EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT TIME
Mira sits inside the backseat of a running cab. She is *
praying aloud. *
MIRA *
Dear Lord, please let this date be *
good. May he have the wealth of 
Mayor Bloomberg. The personality of *
Jon Stewart. The face of Michael *
Fassbender. *
(beat, sure, why not?) *
The penis of Michael Fassbender.  
The cab driver clicks the meter back on, impatiently. *
MIRA (CONT’D) *
I’m going, I’m going. *
INT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER
Mira enters the restaurant, tentatively. She approaches a 
hostess. 
MIRA
Hi. I’m here to meet a man I’ve 
never met before on a blind date. 
He’s in finance, so I’m assuming 
he’s in a suit. Probably a fancy 
one. He’s Caucasian. 
HOSTESS
(annoyed)
Does this Caucasian man have a 
first or last name?
MIRA
Oh! Yes. Dennis. 
The hostess gestures to a HANDSOME GUY IN A CORNER BOOTH. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
(psyched, to herself)
Whoa. Dennis. Way to look. *
INT. RESTAURANT - SOON AFTER
Mira sits with Dennis at a table.  

31
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  30.
MIRA
Hi. I’m Mira. Sorry I’m late. Just 
came from a delivery. Threw this on 
and raced over. 
DENNIS
You look very pretty for having *
raced over. 
MIRA
That is so sweet. But yeah, like I 
said, I’m so not prepared in any *
way for this date. Or is it even a 
date? I don’t care - I just like to 
meet interesting people.  
DENNIS *
It’s a date. *
Mira opens the menu, happily. *
MIRA
What should I get? I’m basically a 
vegetarian. I eat chicken and fish 
and hamburgers. Never steak. 
INT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER
MIRA
Wall Street, huh? So you guys must 
have access to a lot of drugs. That 
must be cool. 
Dennis laughs. 
DENNIS
I don’t have access to drugs, 
actually. Do you?
MIRA
No, I hate drugs. I don’t even know 
how to do them. I didn’t know pot 
and marijuana were the same thing 
until college. 
We see Mira discreetly cross off “Drugs” with a golf pencil 
on a small list that is sitting on her lap. Her beeper goes 
off. She silences it. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
Sorry about that. 
(then)
(MORE)

32
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  31.
MIRA (CONT’D)
But the stress of your job, finance *
is an emotional rollercoaster, I 
bet. Good thing there’s so many 
therapists in the city. 
DENNIS
I wouldn’t know. I go running when 
I’m stressed. 
Mira smiles, crosses off “Depression” on her list. 
MIRA
Me too. Well, slow jogging. And I 
mean slow. Like elderly people have 
passed me, before. 
DENNIS
That sounds really cute, actually. *
Dennis places his hand on Mira’s. *
DENNIS (CONT’D) *
Carl said you were kind of crazy *
and dramatic. But you’re not that *
way at all. *
Mira smiles. YES. YES. SEE? I CAN CHANGE! *
MIRA
I hate drama. I’m like Mary J. *
Blige. *
Mira’s phone starts vibrating.
DENNIS
Boy, you’re blowing up. 
MIRA
It’s stupid. I hate it.  
Mira takes the battery out of her phone and drops it in her 
water. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
Battery destroyed. My calm, adult *
self is all yours. *
DENNIS
I love it. 
MIRA
(then, glancing at card)
Say, what are your feelings 
on...um...huh. 

33
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  32.
She glances at her card. It says: “Married” *
MIRA (CONT’D)
How do I put this...umm, are you *
married?
DENNIS
What? No. Why would I be on a date 
with you if I was married? 
MIRA
(psyched)
Yeah, you’re right. My question 
made no sense. I think maybe I’m a 
little tipsy, because I barely ate, 
because my appetite is so small. 
The hostess comes over: *
HOSTESS
Miss? You have an emergency phone 
call. 
DENNIS
If you need to take it, go. 
MIRA
One second, please. And please 
don’t disappear or go anywhere or I 
won’t be sure I didn’t dream this 
entire date. 
Dennis smiles warmly. 
INT. BY THE WOMEN’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Mira’s on the phone, very angry.  
MIRA
Are you seriously calling me on my 
date? How did you even know I was 
here?
MAX (O.S.)
The large woman at your office told 
me. 
MIRA
I’m going to kill Betsy. Are you 
happy now, Max? You are responsible 
for that large woman’s imminent 
termination. 

34
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  33.
MAX (O.S.)
I’m really scared, Dr. Mira.  
Please come see my mom.
MIRA
I’m on a date, Max.  Do you even 
understand the difficulty of a 
chubby 31-year-old woman going on a 
legit date with a professional 
white male who is not bald?
MAX (O.S.)
Huh?
MIRA
Fine.  Fine.  Dammit.
INT. RESTAURANT TABLE - MOMENTS LATER
Mira stands by a bewildered Dennis, holding her coat.  
DENNIS *
You’re leaving? Can’t someone else *
cover for you?
MIRA
Technically yes, but I really need 
to go. 
He looks puzzled. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
I don’t have many patients. But the 
ones I do have chose me when they 
have literally dozens of other 
better options in my own building. 
So if they’re willing to take that 
chance on me, I feel like the least 
I can do is be there when they’re *
having a baby. 
DENNIS
So, I’ll just finish dinner by 
myself. 
MIRA
I had a great time. You’re *
incredibly cute, and from what I *
can tell, you have no *
imperfections. I’m sorry I’m not *
able to stay.  I hope we can go out 
again sometime.

35
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  34.
DENNIS
(no way)
Sure. I’ll call you. 
MIRA
(sad, goodbye) *
Looking forward to it. 
Mira exits.  She kicks the wall on the way out. *
MIRA (CONT’D) *
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! *
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Mira runs out in her cocktail dress. 
MIRA
Taxi!
There are no taxis. 
MIRA (CONT’D) *
Dammit! *
EXT. STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Mira books it down the street. She stops and takes off her 
heels, sprinting. 
MIRA *
Dammit! *
EXT. ST. ELIZABETH’S MEDICAL CENTER - CONTINUOUS
Mira races in. She slides into the elevator. She hits her *
shoes against the wall, annoyed. *
INT. LABOR & DELIVERY - CONTINUOUS
Mira bursts in. 
MIRA
Marilyn! Prep the patient. I’m 
scrubbin’ in!
INT. HOSPITAL - DOCTORS’ LOCKER ROOM
Mira hurls her purse on the floor and opens her locker. Close- *
up as she presses play on the iPod dock. We hear Beyonce’s *
“Countdown” play. Listening to this song, she closes her eyes *
for a moment, centering herself. She opens her eyes with a *
new-found focus. *

36
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  35.
We now see why Mira is our hero: alone in the doctors’ locker 
room, she has a confidence and energy we have not seen 
before. To the beat of this awesome song, Mira looks in the *
mirror. She is ready and psyched. She takes off her earrings, 
puts her hair in a bun, takes out her contacts, puts on her 
glasses, washes her hands, and gets ready for the delivery.  
She is all business.  She’s calm, confident.  
We see her walk in slow-mo out of the doctors’ locker room in 
her scrubs to the operating room like Danny Ocean. Who 
wouldn’t want this woman to be her doctor? 
INT. HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
Nasreen and Max are there. They look terrified. 
MIRA
Max, your baby sister is upside 
down, so I need to do an emergency 
c-section on your mom. Will you 
tell her?
Max translates. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
To do that, we’re going to have to 
put you under. 
Max translates. Nasreen nods. *
MAX
I don’t want to leave her. 
MIRA
It’s going to be okay. I do these 
all the time, and I know what I’m 
doing.  
Max translates. Nasreen nods. 
MIRA (CONT’D)
(to Max)
Hey.  You’re going to be okay, too.  
I promise. Sit right outside. Take 
my phone. 
Mira gestures to the phone. Max takes it and leaves. 
EXT. OPERATING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
Mira is operating. We see Brooks watching from the window of 
the operation room.

37
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  36.
INT. RECOVERY ROOM - TWO HOURS LATER
Nasreen holds her baby girl with Max next to her. They look *
to Mira gratefully. Mira smiles back, going over details of *
the surgery. *
INT. HOSPITAL - DOCTORS’ LOUNGE - AN HOUR LATER *
Mira sits in the doctors’ lounge playing Connect Four by 
herself on a table. On the TV we see When Harry Met Sally is *
playing. Billy Crystal is running through the Manhattan *
streets. *
BILLY CRYSTAL (V.O.) *
...When you realize you want to *
spend the rest of your life with *
somebody, you want the rest of your *
life to start as soon as possible. *
Mira watches, a little sad. Brooks stands watching it in the *
doorway. *
BROOKS *
Who would actually do that? You *
don’t need to run. You can just see *
her the next day. *
MIRA *
What? Who wouldn’t run?  *
They look at each other. *
MIRA (CONT’D) *
How are we the same species? *
Brooks sits down at the same table. *
BROOKS *
I’m assuming, date is cancelled? *
Mira nods, a little miserable. *
BROOKS (CONT’D) *
Who was the guy?
MIRA
An analyst. 
BROOKS
What did he analyze?

38
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  37.
MIRA
I don’t know. Stocks or something? 
Files? But he made a lot of money *
and he wasn’t clinically depressed. 
BROOKS
Whoa. Book a church. *
MIRA *
Maybe I won’t get married. Maybe  *
I’ll travel and take lovers and be *
friends with Gail and Oprah.  *
BROOKS *
Plenty of unmarried women have *
fulfilling lives. They adopt *
animals, volunteer. *
MIRA
You know what? This pizza sucks.  *
The food was better in jail.
BROOKS
Then why are you eating all of it?  
It’s to share. *
MIRA
This is not an individual pizza?  
God, pizzas are getting so small 
these days. 
BROOKS
Well, if he’s not depressed, he’s 
probably a murderer, or in love *
with his mom or something. Or both. *
(then) *
You know, you actually didn’t do a *
terrible job with that breach. *
MIRA
I knew it, stalker! You were 
lurking like a vulture! *
BROOKS
Yeah, my master plan was that you’d *
get distracted and make a rambling, 
offensive speech, and then, I’d *
pounce. 
MIRA
(amazed)
That was kind of funny, Brooks. *

39
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  38.
BROOKS *
I supposed we’re both capable of *
impressing each other, once a *
decade or so. *
They sit in not-unfriendly silence. *
MIRA *
You know what? This morning, I woke *
up in jail because I was broken up *
over a guy who fixes teeth for a *
living. Now, I’m watching one of my *
favorite movies, I have a new *
patient, I just delivered a baby *
into this world, and- *
(extra proudly) *
I barely ate anything today. This *
is working. This is progress. *
BROOKS
Connect four. *
MIRA
You had to mess it up, didn’t you. 
Mira knocks over the game and leaves the room. Brooks looks 
off a her: what a weirdo. *
INT. MIRA’S APARTMENT - LATE THAT SAME NIGHT *
Mira’s in pajamas, talking on the phone in her living room. *
GWEN (O.S.) *
So you stood up your rich, not *
bald, not-fat, not-depressed, not- *
married blind date I set you up *
with. *
MIRA *
I did not stand him up. I just had *
to leave before dinner came. *
We hear Mira’s buzzer. *
GWEN (O.S.) *
Who is that? It’s 2am. *
MIRA *
Delivery. *
(then) *
Besides, I’m not even sure he *
really does do Beyonce’s finances. *
Wouldn’t he have led with that? I *
feel like maybe he was a murderer. *

40
Untitled Mindy Kaling Show     Pilot 1/9/12  39.
GWEN (O.S.) *
I’m never setting you up again. *
MIRA *
(with love) *
Yes you are, Gwenny. Because I’m *
changing, I can really feel it. *
Tomorrow will be different. *
The door opens. It’s Jeremy. He smiles and comes inside and *
starts taking off his clothes. *
MIRA (CONT’D) *
(a little guilty) *
And if not tomorrow, the day after. *
I swear. *
She hangs up the phone. She smiles. *
END OF SHOW
