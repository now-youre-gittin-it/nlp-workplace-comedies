COLD OPEN
EXT. H& H BAGELS, BROADWAY -LATE MORNING
LISA LEMON, 34, walks up to the bagel store, reading the
paper, wearing her ipod. Two Upper West Side moms chat,
blocking the entrance with their enormous double
strollers.
MOM 1
I nursed Zach til he was 22 months...
LISA
Excuse me...
MOM 2
Weren't you worried about nipple
confusion?
LISA
Excuse me...
MOM 1
No. He went right from my breast toa
sippy cup.
LISA
That happened to me once. Can I get by?
They still don't hear her.
MOM 2
What about silicone nipple shields?
Lisa has no choice but to back up a few steps and take a
running jump over the children and into the bagel place.
The moms are appalled.
MOM 1
If you had kids, you would not be
laughing!
INT. H&H BAGELS, NEW YORK - MOMENTS LATER
Lisa waits in a long line leading to two registers.
A GUY on a cell phone enters. He ignores the line and
goes up to the other register.
LISA
Whoa, whoa. Excuse me. There's a line,
buddy.

3
2.
The guy points to where he's standing.
GUY
There's two lines.
LISA
No, what? No. There's one line, we're in
it.
GUY
I don't think so.
The guy goes back to talking on his cell phone. He holds
his finger up to the counter girl to wait.
LISA
You don't think so? You think there's
two lines and we all chose to be in this
one and you're the only genius who got in
the other line?
(looks to others)
Do you believe this guy?
The other people just shrug and avert their eyes. The
back half of the line goes and lines up behind the guy.
LISA (CONT'D)
What are you doing?! He screws you over
and now you're lining up behind him?
The stroller moms join the back of his line. They stare
Lisa down.
LISA (CONT'D)
Will not one of you stand with me?!
GUY
Hey, shut up--
(into his phone}
What kind do you want?
Shut up?!! Lisa is now at the front of her line, boiling
mad.
COUNTER GIRL
Can I help you?
LISA
Yeah, Teli take everything. I want every
bagel in this place.
(to everyone)
I'm buying all the bagels.

3.
Lisa hands her a credit card. The cell phone guy rolis
his eyes.
ALL
What?! Come on, lady. Boo! Etc...
LISA
It's for the qood of everyone!
EXT. BROADWAY. - MOMENTS LATER
*Old Skool" opening credit sequence to music in the style
of "My Red Letter Day" from The Ziegfeld Follies.
A beaming Lisa passes out bagels to everyone she sees.
Some people are grateful. Most are mistrustful and throw
them away as soon as she passes. She heads through town
and ends up at 30 ROCKEFELLER PLAZA!
ACT ONE
INT. NBC STUDIOS, NEW YORK - DAY
The studio's homebase set. Workmen are polishing a big
sign that reads, "Friday Night Bits with Jenna DeCarlo,"
Pull back through the picture window to where KENNETH a
bright and chirpy (Clay Aiken type) NBC page is giving a
tour. He stands next to a life-size standee of impish
comedian Jenna DeCarlo.
KENNETH
And this is the set of the "Friday Night
Bits with Jenna DeCarlo."
(points to standee)
It's a real funny ladies' comedy show for
ladies.
TOURIST
What time is it on?
KENNETH
Fridays at 10. But, seriously, sir, it's
just for ladies. Candy quiz! Can
anybody name other shows that only ladies
like?
TOURIST
Desperate Housewives?

5
4.
KENNETH
Yes.
Kenneth throws the guy a piece of candy.
TOURIST 2
"Sex in The City?"
KENNETH
No.
{throws candy)
I'm sorry, it's Sex and the City. I
cannot accept that.
Kenneth does not throw the guy candy.
The elevator doors open and Lisa comes out, carrying one
small bag of bagels.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Hey, everybody, here's someone you'd
never get to meet. This is the head-
writer of Friday Night Bits, Lisa Lemon.
Kenneth claps. The tour group stares blankly. Lisa
smiles embarrassedly and waves.
LISA
Hi.
Beat. A fat kid in the front burps.
INT. STUDIO
Lisa runs into PETE HORNBERGER, 43, her friend and
longtime producer.
PETE
What's up? Have you looked at that
"Judgemental Baby" sketch? Cause it's
still seven minutes long.
LISA
Yikes, okay. Hey, you gotta tell that
NBC page to take it down a notch.
PETE
Who Kenneth?
LISA
He just embarrassed me in front of a
whole tour group.

6
5.
oo
PETE
talk to him.
(notices bagels)
What's this?
LISA
(smiles)
I was in the bagel store and this quy
comes in--
INT. WRITERS' ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
At a large conference table, TOOFER, 25, an African-
American Harvard guy writer and FRANK, 27, a heavyset
writer with long ZZ Top hair and glasses, read the
papers.
In the corner, SARIE, a gorgeous 22 year old assistant
(of the spray-tanned platinum-haired Hilton variety)
answers the phone.
SARIE
Friday Night Bits. Okay, hold on, I'1l
connect you.
She somehow looks sexy
Frank stare at her. Next call.transferring calls. Toofer and
SARIE (CONT'D)
Friday Night Bits. Our fax number?
Sarie kneels backwards on her chair to look at the fax
machine, a lower back tattoo is revealed. -Toofer gives
Frank $5 (clearly, they had a bet.)
Lisa enters, finishing her story to Pete.
LISA
And I was like, "Give me all the bagels,
dammit!"
PETE
(takes bagel)
Wow. That is the longest stroy I've ever
had to listen to to get a free bagel.
Pete continues down the hall. Toofer complains to Lisa
immediately.

7
6.
TOOFER
Chumley, you have got to talk to someone
upstairs about getting us a stock of
beverages.
LISA
Good morning.
TOOFER
I mean, surely our massive conglomerate
parent company could spring for a samovar
of coffee.
FRANK
Or, like, a big coffee dispenser.
TOOFER
That's what a samovar is.
FRANK
Sorry, I wasn't raised gay.
JOSH, 23, enters. He is an adorable young comedian/cast
member on "The Jenna DeCarlo Show."
JOSH
Hey, who does this sound like?
Josh does a flawless imitation of President Bush.
JOSH (CONT'D)
"My fellow Americans, the situation in
Iraq grows more tense each day. The
insurgeons and evil-spreaders has left me
no choice but to ask for a do-over."
TOOFER
Martin Van Buren?
FRANK
Ron Jeremy?
Josh is playful, unfazed by their meanness.
JOSH
No, it was supposed to be your mom.
FRANK
No. My mom's voice is way lower.

8
7.
TOOFER
(to Lisa)
Dude, can we at least send out for
coffee?
LISA
Yeah, but I'm not treating. I just spent
$600 on bagels. Wanna know why?
NO ONE BITES.
ALL
Nah... no thanks... etc.
LISA
Sarie, can we order some coffees?
SARIE
(laying on the couch)
Yeah, I'll have a soy latte.
Sarie goes back to her magazine. Lisa looks at her for a
beat, then writes down the coffee order herself.
LISA
Sarie, soy latte. Josh?
JOSH
Large oreo brownie mochaccino, please.
With whipped cream.
LISA
23. Must be nice. Toofer?
TOOFER
Short non-fat Ethiopian Yergacheffe.
FRANK
That's what you are, isn't it?
TOOFER
{ignores him)
And if they don't have that blend then,
please, just a steamed milk with a skoche
of Amarretto syrup.
LISA
You really are gross.
Toofer smiles and tips an imaginary hat.
LISA (CONT'D)
Frank?

9
8.
eo
FRANK
A hamburger.
LISA
That's not...
FRANK
What? It's the same price.
LISA
Fine.
INT. HALLWAY - LATER
Pete gently reprimanding Kenneth the page.
PETE
--and you probably don't need to
introduce the writers to the tour group.
KENNETH
I agree. I thought they would find it
interesting, but they really did not. So
I took them downstairs and showed them
Debra Norville's private toilet--
CUT TO:
INT. OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF DEBRA NORVILLE'S PRIVATE TOILET.
Kenneth addresses a large tour group outside her
bathroom.
KENNETH
.-.to be used by no one but her.
Loud embarrassing toilet sounds emanate from within.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Cops !
CUT BACK TO:
INT. HALLWAY
PETE
Yeah, it's been my experience, Kenneth,
that peaple do best with as little
information as possible.
® (MORE)

10
9.
PETE (CONT'D)
If you pass a celebrity with the tour
group, just respect their privacy.
KENNETH
I don't know. Conan O'Brien gets real
mad if I don't make a big fuss over him.
PETE
Okay, well, feel it out. Make eye
contact with the person. Try to read
their facial expression. Do they want
the attention?
KENNETH
I promise I'll get it right, Mr.
Hornberger.
PETE
I'm sure you will.
KENNETH
(tearing up)
I just love television so much.
PETE
We all do.
INT. WRITER'S ROOM. - A LITTLE LATER
Lisa and the writers are sitting around the table
rewriting a sketch. But Lisa has stopped to tell them
her bagel story.
LISA
And I was, like, "Screw you! I'm buying
all the bagels!"
The boys are not impressed or interested.
FRANK
That's great. You should make that into
a movie for the Lifetime Network.
TOOFER
"All the Bagels: The Lisa Lemon Story."
LISA
Starring Linda Hunt. Okay, where were
we?
Frank reads a part aloud.

11
10.
FRANK
Bottom of 4. "Hey, kids, who wants a big
bowl of Flakey-o's?"
LISA
I don't like "Flakey-o's." What's a
better fake cereal name?
FRANK
Oat Bung?
TOOFER
Chocolate Log Jam.
LISA
Cornholes?
FRANK
Sugar Cornholes.
TOOFER
Frosted mini-guns.
LISA.
Meat Puffs?
TOOFER
Kashi Go Poo.
Pete enters. Phone rings. Sarie answers it.
LISA
Pete. Fake cereal name.
PETE
Branfuckers. [bleeped]
LISA
We have a winner.
SARIE
Pete, they want you and Lisa on the 50th
floor.
PETE
Who, Gary?
TOOFER
Get him to pay for my Samovar.
LISA
I'll get it. I'11 get it right now. I'm
still fired up from my bagel incident.

12
il.
Josh is passing through.
JOSH
(to Frank)
What bagel incident?
FRANK
If you ask her, I will stab you.
LISA
What do we want?
TOOFER
A coffee maker, coffee, and an array of
milks.
FRANK
Three cases of name-brand soda a day.
SARIE
Cable tv.
TOOFER
A snack basket.
yy JOSH
Custom made Nikes with the name of the
show on the tongue and our initials on
the heel.
LISA
Josh, bend it, don't break it.
INT. ELEVATOR BANK - CONTINUOUS
Pete and Lisa wait for the elevator.
LISA
Gary will give us all this, right?
PETE
Of course he will. He's the nicest man
in the world. Remember when he found
that baby bird in the park?
CUT TO:

13
12.
INT. GARY'S OFFICE - THE PAST
c.U. of Gary Luderman, 50, a square-looking corporate guy
in a suit. He is intently feeding a baby bird with an
eye dropper.
GARY LUDERMAN
Hey, fella. Hey, fella.
{smiles up to the camera)
I'm gonna name him Fella.
CUT BACK TO:
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARY'S OFFICE.
LISA
(sings)
Gary Luderman is the nicest man in the
wooorld!
They turn the corner into...
INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY
The whole place is under noisy renovation. Workmen
everywhere.
Pete and Lisa step in to see JACK DONAGHY, 45, handsome
and impeccably dressed, kicks his way into the room
through a partially ripped out wall.
LISA
Where's Gary?
JACK
Gary's dead. I'm Jack Donaghy. New VP
of development for
NBC/GE/Universal/Vivendi/ Kmart
PETE
We own Kmart now?
JACK
No, we don't. So why are you dressed
like we do?
Pete and Lisa look at their overly casual work clothes.

14
13.
INT. WRITER'S ROOM. - SAME TIME
Josh, Toofer and Frank are working. Sarie answers the
phone.
SARIE
Friday Night Bits.
(beat)
This is Sarie.
(exasperated)
Mommy, why are you calling me?
JOSH
{to Toofer)
Are you guys just staring at the new
receptionist or are you actually trying
to levitate her with your minds?
IOOFER
Shhh, I have to hear this.
They eavesdrop on Sarie.
SARIE
Of course I showed up for work. You
don't have to, like, check on me all the
time.
I (quietly)
took the helicopter.
FRANK
{to Josh)
Her parents are some rich famous big
shots and they got her this job because
they want her to learn the value of work.
Sarie takes out her gum, folds it in a dollar bill and
throws it out.
JOSH
Who are her parents?
FRANK
She won't say.
TOOFER
She says it would affect the way we treat
her.
JOSH
No, I would still try to make out with
her.

15
14.
FRANK
She doesn't do it for me. My perfect
woman is a standard size 12, still in her
waitress uniform, with her kid asleep in
the next room,
The other two nod in reluctant agreement. That is kind
of hot.
INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME
Kenneth is giving another tour.
KENNETH
Rockefeller Center was built in the
1930's by--anyone?
TOURIST
The Rockefellers?
Kenneth throws the guy a piece of candy.
KENNETH
Correct. Studio 8E was constructed in
i951 for a show called "The Vicks Vap-o-
Rub Fun Hour." In the 1970's it was used
for a talk show by a gentleman named Phil
Donahoo. And now it's home to the Jenna
DeCarlo--
Kenneth sees JENNA DECARLO come off the elevator. He
tries to assess her mood.
She takes off her sunglasses and looks at Kenneth. She
has a crazy wide-eyed expression that means, "Don't
bother me." But her face is so animated and friendly
that Kenneth can't "read" it.
Kenneth smiles at Jenna. Jenna smiles/grimaces back.
There is a back and forth moment of panic between Kenneth
and Jenna as they try to interpret each others'
expressions. Then, one of the tour group recognizes her--
TOURIST 6
Hey, that's Jenna DeCarlo!
OTHERS
Ooh, Jenna DeCarlo! Jenna! Etc.

16
Ls.
Flashbulbs. Jenna looks hung-over and disheveled. The
exact opposite of her picture on the standee behind her.
She can't help but blurt out her thoughts to the crowd.
JENNA
Hi, let me explain that I'm really hung
over right now and that's why I look like
this. But I'm not normally hung over on
a Wednesday. I tried a new tapas
restaurant in my neighborhood last night
and the waiter recognized me so he kept
giving me free mojitos-- which doesn't
happen all the time, I'm not like, some
gross famous person-- but he kept
bringing them and I don't usually drink
hard liquor cause I'm really small and I
can get drunk so easily--
(she starts to giggle with
embarrassment )
I mean, I don't get drunk frequently.
She grabs the arm of a tourist for emphasis.
JENNA (CONT'D)
I'm just saying that if I look a little
green there are extenuating
circumstances.
Jenna exits around a corner. Beat.
KENNETH
How about that? Jenna DeCarlo, every--
Jenna comes back around.
JENNA
But I don't want people to think I'm not
friendly. I'm just nauseous and I have
stomach issues--
The group nods politely.
JENNA (CONT'D)
Okay.
She starts to exit.
JENNA (CONT'D)
Forget I said "stomach issues." Okay.
Bye.

17
16.
INT. JACK'S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Pete and Lisa sit gingerly on the edge of the couch.
Workmen work behind them.
Jack sits at his desk which has a lot of exposed wires
hanging over it. Nearby we see the legs of a workman on
a ladder.
PETE
I'm surprised you're renovating. This is
such a nice office.
JACK
It's a great office. But sometimes you
have to change things that are perfectly
good just to make them your own.
Pete and Lisa look a little worried.
Jack's nerdy MALE ASSISTANT appears and hands Jack a note
written on a post-it.
JACK (CONT'D)
call her back. Is she at the White
House number?
Assistant nods. He hands him another post-it.
JACK (CONT'D)
Tell them I need a 4 a.m. tee time.
He hands him another post-it.
JACK (CONT'D)
About five inches, but it's thick.
Pete and Lisa look at each other.
As he exits, the assistant gets a little shock to the
head from a dangling wire and flinches slightly. Jack
turns his attention to Pete and Lisa.
JACK (CONT'D)
Are you familiar with the award-winning
GE Tri-vection oven?
LISA
E don't cook very much,

18
17.
JACK
Sure. I got you. New York third wave
feminist. College-educated. Single and
pretending to be happy about it. Over-
scheduled, under-sexed. You buy any
magazine that says "healthy body image"
on the cover, but your kitchen's got
nothing but Snackwells and expired
yogurts. You reject traditional female
roles, but every two years you take up
knitting for a week.
PETE
(impressed)
That's dead on.
LISA
Are you gonna guess my weight now?
JACK
You don't want me to do that.
PETE
That knitting thing is just uncanny. How
do you do that?
JACK
Market research, my friend. Years and
years of market research... that lead to
my greatest triumph, the Tri-vection
oven.
PETE
My wife wants one of those.
The assistant reappears. Another post-it to read.
JACK
(to the assistant)
Yes, but I'il need my kevlar vest.
(back to Pete and Lisa with a
smile)
The Trivection oven cooks perfect food
five times faster than a conventional
even, because it uses three kinds of
heat: thermal technology, for consistent
temperature; GE Precise Air™ convection
technology, for optimal air circulation;
and microwave technology, for
unbelievable speed. With three kinds of
heat, you can cook a turkey in 22
minutes.

19
18.
PETE
Wow. That's impressive.
JACK
The people upstairs agree. That's why
they promoted me. That's why I'm here to
re-tool your show.
LISA
Re-tool what now?
JACK
I'm the new Vice President of East Coast
Television and Microwave Oven
Programming.
LISA
That sounds like you program microwave
ovens.
JACK
(to his asst.)
See, I told you that was imprecise. Make
it "Vice President of East Coast
Television Programming and Microwave Oven-
LISA
Czar?
JACK
I like you. You have the boldness of a
much younger woman.
Lisa is offended. Some sparks literally fly, from the
construction behind her.
PETE
You know, Jack, Lisa and I have worked
together on a bunch of shows over the
last ten years, and I know Gary was very
pleased--
JACK
Pete, I've seen the show. The littie
gal's good.
LISA
Jenna.
JACK
And the skits are decent, but you're
missing that third kind of heat.

20
19.
LISA
There's the kind of heat that rises from
dog poop. Maybe we could use that.
JACK
Think about Lawrence Jordan.
PETE
The black guy?
JACK
The black movie star. I flew with him
recently on a private jet to the Super
Bowl, and he was very entertaining.
LISA
Isn't he, um... crazy?
JACK
Lawrence has had his problems in the last
few years.
CUT TO:
EXT. CALIFORNIA FREEWAY - DAY
African-American comedy star LAWRENCE JORDAN, 35, runs
down through traffic in nothing but tighty whities.
LAWRENCE
I am a jedi! I ama jedi!
CUT BACK TO:
INT. JACK'S OFFICE.
JACK
But it's important to remember that he
was never charged with any crime. It's
not illegal to fall asleep on your
neighbor's roof.
PETE
Nor should it be.
JACK
Lawrence Jordan is the "third heat."
PETE
So would he join the cast...?

21
20.
JACK
Join the cast, permanent guest host-- I'm
going to meet with him this afternoon and
see what he thinks--
Lisa clears a place to lay down on the coffee table.
JACK (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
LISA
Sometimes when I have these stress
dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I
come out of it.
The Assistant scribbles then hands her a post-it.
LISA (CONT'D)
(reads)
"This is not a dream."
JACK
Jonathan, take Pete and help him pick out
a Trivection oven for his wife. ;
PETE
(pleased)
Hey.
LISA
Wait.
Lisa takes out her list.
LISA (CONT'D)
We also want a coffee machine, a snack
basket --
JACK
Done. Jonathan?
The assistant takes her list of demands. After he and
Pete exit...
JACK (CONT'D)
Lisa, I've heard a lot of good things
about you,
LISA
Well, a lot of that stuff I don't do
anymore.

22
21.
JACK
I just want you to know that your job is
secure. You're gonna be essential to
transforming the show.
LISA
No, no, no, Jack. Jenna is my friend and
we like our show the way it is. It may
not get the highest ratings, but we have
our own little following, and I'm not
going to let you come in here and turn it
into some kind of--
JACK
Hit?
LISA
Just let me talk to her before you make
any concrete--
The wall behind her comes tumbling down. A chunk of
drywall hits her on the head.
LISA (CONT'D)
Mother-effer-!
She falls down.
ACT TWO
INT. A HAIR SALON SET
A sketch from the show. Josh wears a fake moustache.
Jenna is performing a crazy character with a goofy voice.
JOSH
Yes, I have an appointment with Louise.
JENNA
Glouise isn't here. I'm Bevergly.
Recognition applause. This is a recurring character.
JENNA (CONT'D)
And I'll be your substitute hair
styglist!
Laughter.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

23
22.
INT. WRITER'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
Toofer and Frank are watching a tape of this sketch.
IOOFER
We should do one where "Bevergly" is a
"grape" counselor.
Toofer hands him a frothy cappuccino in a glass mug.
Across the room, Josh is going through a large snack
basket
JOSH
Just tell me who your parents are.
SARIE
No. You couldn't handle it.
JOSH
Okay, I'm gonna try to guess who they are
from looking at your face.
He studies her.
JOSH (CONT'D)
Blond hair, little nose, kind of
Swedish... Your mom is... Cheryl Tiegs
and your dad is...
(checks out her body)
Stephen Hawking.
Sarie punches him in the arm.
JOSH (CONT'D)
What? Cause you're smart!
INT. HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER
Pete is talking to Kenneth again.
PETE
...and Jenna DeCarlo was very upset.
KENNETH
I tried to read her face, but it's so
rubbery!

24
23.
PETE
How bout this? As a rule, if you see a
celebrity when you're with the tour
group, do not bother them.
KENNETH
Is that a quideline, or a rule? Cause I
respond well to structure.
PETE
Let's say it's a rule.
INT. HALL. - SAME TIME
Lisa gets off the elevator holding an ice pack to her
head. She runs smack into Jenna. Lisa acts weird and
awkward.
LISA
Hey.
JENNA
Hey. What happened to your head?
LISA
The sky is falling. Do you have a
minute?
JENNA
No. i have a costume fitting for the
"Judgemental Baby" sketch.
LISA
Ahh. I'11 find you after.
JENNA
You seem upset.
LISA
You seem upset.
JENNA
I'm hung over.
LISA
(seemingly reminiscing)
Remember, like, five years ago when you
were still waitressing and I was temping
at that law firm and we used to do improv
shows for free at night?

25
24.
JENNA
Yeah.
LISA
Did we hate it?
JENNA
Yeah. We hated it a lot.
LISA
That's what I thought.
INT. WRITER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Lisa enters to find everyone excitedly enjoying the new
high-end coffee machine, snack basket, cable tv, etc.
Toofer hands her a cappuccino.
TOOFER
Well done, m' lady!
FRANK
How'd you get everything so fast?
LISA
What can I say? I'm a hardass.
She ducks into Pete's office.
INT. PETE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
He is finishing up a phone call.
PETE
Well, my condolences. Please let me know
where we can send flowers. Okay.
He hangs up.
PETE (CONT'D)
Ugh, poor Gary.
LISA
How did he die?
PETE
Killed by a deer.
LISA
What?
N,

26
25.
PETE
He used to feed the deer every morning at
his house upstate. And then he got an
injunction from the township saying he
had to stop. So he did. Two days later,
he goes out to get his paper, and the
deer go mad.
Pete makes an accompanying hand gesture like deer paws
clawing at someone.
LISA
They just went mad?
She mimics the same gesture. Pete nods and does it
again.
PETE
He stopped feeding them and they turned
on him.
LISA
What are we gonna do? We quit, right?
Do we quit?
PETE
Not me. My twins need braces.
f
LISA
The older twins or the identicals?
PETE
All four. They've got mouths like
piranhas.
He hands her a picture from his desk.
LISA
Ew. They do.
PETE
But sometimes with a thing like this, if
you wait it out, it goes away on its own.
LISA
{still looking at the
picture)
No, you gotta get the braces.
PETE
Jack Donaghy, I'm talking about. So he
meets with crazy Lawrence Jordan today.
(MORE)

27
26.
PETE (CONT'D)
Jordan'11 ask for too much money or he'll
show up wearing a child's swimsuit and a
shower cap and Donaghy will change his
mind. Nobody needs to know this ever
came up.
Josh enters.
JOSH
Oh, hey, awesome. Just the people I was
looking for. I'm working on this bit
about celebrities doing commercials, like-
(imitates Christopher Walken
"This isperfectly)Christopher Walken for Tropicana
orange juice. Try the juice. It's
very... tangy" Or, um--
{imitates Lawrence Jordan
perfectly)
"Yo, this is Lawrence Jordan, star of
'Black Cop/White. Cop' and when I want a
good night's sleep, I sleep on my
neighbor's roof. But now that I'm making
a comeback, I sleep at the Best Western.
Best Western. It's like sleeping on Ted
Danson's roof. Holla!"
LISA
Okay, I don't know what you've heard, but
Lawrence Jordan is not joining the cast.
He is not taking over for Jenna. We are
not turning into The Lawrence Jordan
Show.
JOSH
What?
She realizes he didn't know any of this.
LISA
Nothing.
PETE
Nicely handled.
INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - SAME TIME
Kenneth is answering questions from another tour group.
KENNETH
Yes, Katie Couric is real tiny in person.

KENNETH (CONT 'D)
'But her boobs are a lot bigger than you
would think.
The elevator doors open and LAWRENCE JORDAN, 30, enters
with a small entourage, looking totally kickass.
Cool music under.
As they get close to the tour group, Kenneth sees
Lawrence [a big movie star!] and, panicking, diverts the
group's attention.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Now, if y'all look over here, you'll see
a water fountain!
Lawrence stops behind the group and waits for Kenneth to
acknowledge him. Kenneth starts to sweat.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Does anyone have any questions about it?
Lawrence gives his posse a look like, "What the heli?
Why isn't this guy acknowledging me?"
LAWRENCE
Yes, I have a question.
(big smile)
How do you feel, NBC Tour? Cause you
look like a portay!
KENNETH
{timidly)
Lawrence Jordan, everybody.
The group applauds excitedly to see Lawrence. Lawrence
goes over and works the crowd.
LAWRENCE
(To a pregnant lady)
You're beautiful, little Mama. You're
doing God's work.
(Talks in a "honky" voice to
a middle aged white guy)
Don't I know you from the insurance
meeting? We've got to sign those papers,
Reginald.
The guy laughs. Lawrence goes to a skinny, sullen, white
teen. Lawrence puts his arm around the kid very
sincerely.

28.
LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
Listen. I know being your age is hard.
But don't you "put on the trench coat."
You hear me? You have a problem, you
call me. Don't put on that trench coat.
The kid nods.
LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
(to everyone)
Live. Life. Love. Laugh!
The group applauds. There is such a thing as "star
quality."
INT. PETE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
JOSH
Does Jenna know?
LISA
I gotta tell her before she hears it
somewhere else.
JOSH
She's been around the block. She can
handle bad news.
LISA
Yeah...
Off Lisa's look...
CUT TO:
INT. A DINER - THE PAST
The waitress serves Jenna her breakfast.
JENNA

I said wheat toast.
She bursts into tears.
CUT BACK TO;

INT. PETE'S OFFICE.
LISA
She's gonna freak out.
Toofer enters, indignant.
TOOFER
I will not work with Lawrence Jordan.
PETE
It's just a rumor.
TOOFER
I worked with him at the MTV awards two
years ago, where he found it endlessly
amusing to show me his johnson.
PETE
How was it?
TOOFER
Considerable. On one cccasion, he had
placed it in a foot-long hot dog bun and
put mustard on it. I loathe him.
Sarie stands in the doorway.
SARIE
He's not that bad. He rents near us in
East Hampton. I saw him once at a charity
polo match.
PETE
Did he seem crazy?
SARIE
No. Well... he was making out with
Martha Stewart...but we've all done that.
They all stare at her for a beat.
SARIE (CONT'D}
Joking.
TOOFER
Have you seen any of his movies? The
guy's sensibility is just cretinous.
LISA
I saw the one where he plays, like, five
different characters.

31
30.
TOOFER
"Black Cop/White Cop"
LISA
No.
JOSH
"Who Dat Ninja?"
LISA
No, he was... god, they all blend
together, don't they? He had to pretend
to be an old lady--
TOOFER
Yes, yes. He actually says the title at
one point...
Off their thinking...
CUT TO:
EXT. DOORWAY A HOUSE. - DAY
A clip from one of Lawrence Jordan's movies. He is
dressed as a big fat white grandma a la Mrs. Doubtfire.
Unseen parties are throwing pies at him.
LAWRENCE
Oh, gracious goodness! You hooligans
better watch out!
A pie hits him. He suddenly sounds masculine and black.
LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
Cause this honky arandma be trippin!
CUT BACK TO:
INT. PETE'S OFFICE
LISA/TOOFER
(relieved to remember}
"Honky Grandma Be Trippin'."
JOSH
Oh, yeah. That movie was hilarious.
Lisa glares at him. Frank bursts in, incredulous.

31.
FRANK
Is what I heard true?!
PETE
No!
FRANK
Gary Luderman got killed by a deer?!
PETE
Oh yeah, by the way, everybody. Gary
Luderman got killed by a deer.
Before anyone can react, Jenna enters. She is ina
ridiculous baby costume [over-sized diaper, pinafore,
bonnet] .
JENNA
You guys, you have to come see this! You
know that crazy actor guy from "Who Dat
Ninja?" He's in our studio! It's
hilarious! You have to see it.
Jenna runs out. They all run out after her.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Every face is pressed up against the picture window of
the studio. They look shocked.
INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME
Lawrence Jordan paces around the homebase set, preaching
to the empty seats.
LAWRENCE
I'm back, America! I'm coming into your
house.
Lawrence grabs the camera and talks into the lens like
Bono.
LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
I'm coming into your house, America!
Jack encourages him proudly from the empty seats.
JACK
We love you, Lawrence! Come into our
homes?

33
32.
Lawrence removes his shirt.
LAWRENCE
I'm the third heat! I'm the third heat!
JACK
You're the third heat, baby!
Out by the picture window, Jenna turns to Lisa,
chuckling.
JENNA
This guy's full-tilt nuts. Am I right?
Kenneth arrives with a tour group.
KENNETH
Here we see the set for "Friday Night
Bits."
(stage whisper)
.Although the industry buzz is it's being
re-tooled into The Lawrence Jordan Sh--
Pete leaps over and chokes Kenneth to shut him up. The
tour group gasps. Jenna turns to Lisa.
JENNA
What did he say?
LISA
Jenna, I have some news. Don't freak
out.
Jenna stares at her wide-eyed for a beat, then...
CUT TO:
EXT. 6H AVE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Jenna, in the baby costume, running through traffic [much
like Lawrence Jordan], out of her mind.
JENNA
I ama jedi! I am a jedi!
INT. STUDIO FLOOR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Everyone's gathered around Lawrence Jordan, he's holding
court. Lisa watches from the balcony above.

33.
LAWRENCE JORDAN
Now at the time, me and Eddie were both
talking to the same girl, 'cept I didn't
know she was a transexual...
Everyone laughs.
LISA
(to herself)
Will not one of you stand with me?
Jack Donaghy walks over to her.
LISA (CONT'D)
Would you like me to review for you
everything you've done wrong so far?
You've hired a guy so crazy that nobody
else in the world will work with him
right now. You brought him in here
without even talking to Jenna first,
which will send her into a two-year
spiral. You're putting him in my hands,
knowing I don't want him here. You gave
my greedy, insatiable writing staff every
toy they asked for, which only means they
will have a longer list of things they
want tomorrow. Don't stop feeding those
deer, Mr. Donaghy, or they will turn on
you.
JACK
You'll make it work.
LISA
What makes you think that?
JACK
Cause your friend Jenna's got nowhere
else to go. You'll be nice to Lawrence,
cause it's not his fault. And you'll
focus all your rage and hatred on me.
LISA
Ugh, you know what? You don't know
everything about me.
She storms out of frame. Jack watches her walk away.
JACK
About 127 pounds.
From off camera, she whips a water bottle at him.

She climbs down into the studio to introduce herself to
Lawrence Jordan.
LISA
Hi, I'm Lisa. I'm--
LAWRENCE
Yes, yes. Lisa Lemon! I know who you
are.
He kisses her hands, dramatically.
LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
The very talented. Very talented.
LISA
Oh, well. Let's not.
LAWRENCE
You're gonna be my Phil Spector, right?
LISA
How's that?
LAWRENCE
You're gonna take my raw black sound and
make it nice for white people's ears.
LISA
Yes. And then I'm gonna kill somebody.
Lawrence thinks this is hilarious.
TAG
INT. TAPAS RESTAURANT - EVENING
Lisa, enters and approaches the maitre'd.
LISA
Hi, I'm here to pick up my baby.
He points to Jenna, still in the baby outfit, in a back
booth, wasted.
JENNA
Tadeo, another mojito!
LISA
No, no. Come on, friend.

Lisa struggles to help Jenna out. She stops by a couple
with a baby near the door.
LISA (CONT'D)
Can I borrow this for five minutes?
EXT. NYC STREET - EVENING
Lisa pushes Jenna down the street in a stroller.
JENNA
I have so much rage.
LISA
It could be worse. You could have nipple
confusion.
