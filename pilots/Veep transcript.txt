GARY 
That’s a fork, Madam Vice President. 
SELINA 
Thanks for the debrief, Gary. 
ANNA 
-..and the VP also needs to meet with 
Senator Hallowes. Ten minutes, preferably 
20, and you might want to make that 
happen in the next five minutes, 
preferably two. 
GARY 
I meant it’s one of the new cornstarch 
forks. I was differentiating it from the 
spork... 
The hybrid spoon-fork. 
ANNA 
I’m just wondering if your imminent 
meeting on Senate vote reform might be 
more important than a spoon-fork? 
SELINA 
Sure, but you know how slowly that stuff 
goes. Like fucking stop-motion animation: 
eliminate anonymous holds here, sliding 
scales for cloture there - just a whole 
bunch of procedural clit-diddling. 
But this is classic - are you 
Listening...? 
ANNA 
I am. I’m one huge ear, tuned only to the 
frequency of your voice. 
SELINA 
This is classic Clean Jobs Commission 
stuff - biodegradable cornstarch utensils 
in most government buildings by the fall. 
Real stuff... 
.»-shit, do these not bend back? 
GARY 
They’ve not perfected that yet, Ma‘am. 
SELINA 
Great. There‘s my first speech as Chair 
of the Clean Jobs Commission: we’ve come 
up with a way for people to eat round 
corners. 
ANNA 
Okay... 
SELINA 
What‘s wrong. You used ‘okay’ like a 
swearword. 
ANNA 
Brett Kagan’s blog. He's picked up on a 
cutlery tweet from our Twitter guys. 
SELINA 
Is this chopsticks, are he saying we're 
anti-Asian...? 
ANNA 
A tweet yesterday said “76 percent of 
government buildings now have cornstarch 
utensils! Let's make it 100! Let’s make 
plastic utensils extinct!” 
SELINA 
Oh, fuck a duck. 
ANNA 
Kagan's publicized it, plastics industry 
are already going crazy, they want 
meetings and statements today. 
SELINA 
Of course they do. Which Club Class 
jerkoff tweeted that? 
ANNA 
Well, officially, you. It was written by 
a staffer, but as Selina Meyer.

4
@ SELINA 
There are seven of me in that office, 
which me wrote it? Glasses me? Tall me? 
Gay bald me? 
ANNA 
I think it was gluten-intolerant me. 
SELINA 
Ryan? Well, iet’s fire gluten-intolerant 
me. Get smelly me to do it. 
ANNA 
And I’1l set up a meeting with the 
Plastics & Cellulose Association. Okay? 
SELINA 
Sure. I'm living the dream. Only it’s 
that dream where I’m meeting men who work 
in plastics. 
ANNA 
They're pretty powerful men. 
SELINA 
No. They work for powerful companies. The 
men themselves look like Pee Wee Herman. 
© Gary holds up a knife. 
GARY 
Do you want to see the cornstarch knife? 
ANNA 
Fuck the knife Gary. 
SELINA 
Yes, on balance Gary, fuck the knife. 
Selina holds her temples, closes her eyes. Gary reaches 
into the big bag and brings out two packs of pills. 
GARY 
Codeine or Ibuprofen? 
SELINA 
Codeine. 
GARY 
Would you like them to switch off the 
sirens? 

SELINA (0.S.) 
No, no, put them back on. 
SELINA 
I mean when these guys were kids, were 
they like, “I want to work with plastic. 
Screw being an astronaut, or Donny 
Osmond, or Kissinger - my ambition is to 
make the least interesting part of a 
cotton bud. And maybe hound the Vice 
President.” 
am 
— 
SELINA (CONT’D) 
Hello Senators. 
GARY 
Okay, over there is Senator Alice Dorsey. 
Husband died two years ago and daughter 
Emily just graduated Harvard. 
SELINA 
Which one is she again? 
GARY 
Two o'clock. 
SELINA 
I’m not a frigging sniper, Gary. 
GARY 
Red dress. Slight mustache. Tiny lips. 
SELINA 
Okay, thank you. 

6
O 
SELINA (CONT'D) 
Alice! Hi! So glad you could make it! 
How's Emily? 
SENATOR DORSEY 
She's good, thank you. 
ANNA 
Is this cutlery thing making the Veep 
toxic? There are more serving staff here 
than Senators. 
SENATOR DORSEY 
I see cutlery is getting some serious 
traction. Not worried by the plastic 
people? 
SELINA 
Plastic people? Makes them sound like GI 
Joe dolls, with no genitals. 
SENATOR DORSEY 
_ ©) I wouldn't know, I grew up with sisters. 
These are good people Selina. They’ve 
given the party a lot of funding, 
genitals or no. 
SELINA 
And I don’t have a problem with that. 
After all, in Ancient Rome the wealth was 
controlled by the eunuchs, right? 
Where is everyone? Weren't we discussing 
one~filibuster-per-bill today? 
SENATOR DORSEY 
We’re all excited by your ‘Re-energizing 
Floor Procedure’ agenda. It’s just - 
there’s a vote coming up, and... 
SELINA 
No, sure. Why should my meeting about the 
need to have more votes get in the way of 
having a vote? 
SENATOR DORSEY 
I’m guessing you're posing a rhetorical 
question. 
SELINA 
ay Why wouldn’t I?
SELINA (CONT'D) 
I don’t want to be here. Make me not be 
here. 
ANNA 
We picked a bad time. It's the vote. 
SELINA 
It’s not the vote, it’s the cutlery. This 
is plastic money. 
GARY 
Credit cards? 
SELINA 
They all get funded by the plastics 
industry, some clownfish tweets about 
cornstarch forks and suddenly I’m like a 
leper with a dirty bomb in one hand and a 
sign in the other saying ‘I Hate 
Plastic’. Jeez, look at it... 
This is embarrassing. This room is 
emptier than Gary’s life. No offence. 
GARY 
None taken. 
SELINA 
I meant you’re life is totally devoted to 
me... 
GARY 
..so doesn't require filling. That’s why 
I took no offence Ma‘am. 
SELINA 
Even Hallowes isn’t here. And she’s one 
of my closest political friends. Bitch. 
Right, I want a tunnel out of this 
meeting. 
ANNA 
Shall we do a Fax And Go? 
Gary nods and Selina moves over to a group of Senators. 
SELINA 
Senators, I'm really sorry but something 
pretty major has just broken. Gary?

GARY 
This has just come in, and it looks big. 
SELINA 
Yep - something large and unusual has 
come up and I’m going to have to head 
back. I am the Vice President, so...that 
happens. 
GARY 
Do you want to go back to the office? 
SELINA 
They're expecting us to be gone for two 
hours. The press will notice. 
ANNA 
We could kill some time. We could walk 
slowly to the East Gate, that’s 15 
minutes. Drive back by the river. 
SELINA 
Okay, we walk the wrong way, but 
purposefully, like we're discussing 
important shit. You and Gary surround me. 
ANNA 
You want us to form a human motorcade? 
SELINA 
It says here 65,000 Americans are 
employed in the plastics industry and I’m 
like Jack The Ripper but with a 
cornstarch knife.


ANNA 
Are you self-Googling? 
SELINA 
I want to know what people are saying 
about me. 
ANNA 
You don’t. Really. Don’t search on your 
name, or your nicknames. Really don’t. 
SELINA 
My nicknames? 
ANNA 
You have some nicknames that it’s 
necessary for us to search on... 
SELINA 
What are they? 
ANNA 
Really? Okay: Grisly Madam, Meyer the 
Liar, The Batcave, Mammary Meyer... 
SELINA 
Is that the breastfeeding legislation? 
GARY 
It is, Ma’am. 
ANNA 
And then just various VP things: Vaguely 
Personable, Viagra Prohibitor and Visible 
Panties. 
SELINA 
I'm sorry - I prohibit Viagra? Because - 
what, because of my looks? Am I hideous? 
GARY 
It‘s just using those initials... 
SELINA 
Yes, to say that a chemical pill which 
guarantees to produce a strong, sustained 
erection in all men, whatever their age 
or medical history, is nullified by me. 
Don't searching that nickname again. 
ANNA 
No, of course. 
DAN 
So this would be where Senator Hallowes 
might meet lobbyists or constituents to 
discuss any issues they might have. 
CONSTITUENT 
She got rid of that emergency trailer 
park pretty quick. Those bastards won’t 
be coming back. 
DAN 
Anna. 
ANNA 
Dan. 
DAN 
You look like you’re on your way to 
somewhere important. 
DAN (CONT’D) 
Honoured to meet you Madam Vice 
President. I’m Dan Egan, I’m with Senator 
Hallowes. 
SELINA 
Well tell her to put on her chemical 
suit, because I’m coming over to see her. 
Anna, you want to....? 
CONSTITUENT 
Madam Vice President, great privilege to 
meet you. Can we talk to you about the 
Mexicans? 
SELINA 
Sure. 
Are my panties visible?
GARY 
No ma’am. I haven’t seen them. 
Selina discretely checks her skirt. Dan takes Anna to one 
side. 
ANNA 
So, Dan, are you a tour guide now? If 
always knew you’d make it to the top. 
DAN 
How was your boss’s meeting? I hear the 
catering was a box of a dozen donuts. 
ANNA 
Fuck you. 
DAN 
I hadn’t finished...”and four of those 
were left over.” 
ANNA 
I hadn’t finished either...”Fuck you Dan. 
You dick.” OK, that’s the small talk 
done. We know Hallowes is avoiding the 
Veep. 
C DAN 
Of course she is. Veep? 
ANNA 
We're pushing Veep as her acceptable 
nickname. 
DAN 
You mean instead of She-Ra? 
ANNA 
We need 20 minutes with Senator Hallowes. 
DAN 
There are a lot of people who need 20 
minutes with probably the next Chair of 
Finance. Take ticket number 89 and.. 
ANNA 
The Veep’s thinking of offering the 
Senator a post on her Clean Jobs 
Commission. 
DAN 
After this plastics thing I think the 
Senator might prefer to attend something 
less contentious, like a Klan meeting. 
_ ANNA 
Come on Dan. Did what we had together 
mean nothing to you?
DAN 
You know it didn’t. 
ANNA 
You remember the restaurant. 
DAN 
It’s my regular second-date 
restaurant. 

Ladies and gentlemen. 

ANNA 
It’s the SRVA Fundraiser tonight. 
ANNA (CONT'D) 
How would you like to stand right next to 
the President? 
DAN 
She gets 10 minutes. 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
I still support him. It was an ill- 
advised comment about offshore funds and, 
you know, Frank’s Chair of the Finance 
Committee so he needs to watch what he 
says... 
SENATOR HALLOWES (CONT’D) 
But, look, we've all said dumb things in 
our lives and I don’t think this is a 
resigning issue for Frank. Okay. Goodbye. 

DAN 
Now all that guy will take from the call 
will be the words ‘dumb’ and ‘resigning’.

CF SENATOR HALLOWES 
Thanks Dan. 
Selina! 

SELINA 
Hi Barbara. You’re not returning my 
calls. You been seeing another VP behind 
my back? 
DAN 
The Senator has been very busy with 
extremely important legislative business. 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
You must remember what that was like, 
Selina, from when you were a Senator? 

SELINA 
You shafting Frank to get Chair of 
Finance? I remember that from my Senate 
©) days. 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
Yep. Officially supporting hin, 
unofficially positioning to take over 
after his sure-fire resignation tomorrow 
afternoon. 
SELINA 
The usual dance. Gary, could you get me a 
coffee from the machine? 
GARY 
Oh, I’ve managed to get a fresh batch of 
those European sweeteners you like so 
much. The French sweeteners? 
SELINA 
Thanks Gary. You’re phenomenal. They’re 
great, great sweeteners. 

SELINA (CONT’D) 

I don't like them especially, they taste 
just like any other sweetener. Sweet. 
It’s not like wine, you don’t say, mmn, 
= sweetener - I'm getting oak, maybe a hint 
of raspberries and, my, is that fennel? 
No, it’s just a harsh chemical sweetener, 
but Gary puts so much effort into getting 
them I don’t have the heart to tell the 
poor bastard. 

SENATOR HALLOWES 
So, I love what you’re doing with the 
whole cutlery thing. 
DAN 
You got Google alerts on all the VP’s 
nicknames? Mrs Doubtmeyer, you got that? 
ANNA 
(No) Yes. 
DAN 
That’s a clever one, because it implies 
she’s both nannying and confused. 
ANNA 
So Hallowes is going to get the Chair of 
the Finance Committee from Frank? 
DAN 
Probably. She wont be very good at it 
though. They‘ll want Frank back. 
ANNA 
Okay. Indiscreet? 
DAN 
She wouldn't believe you over me so I can 
be honest. Senator Hallowes is mediocre. 
If they did greetings cards that said 
“You’re basically adequate”, that’s what 
people would send her. 
SELINA 
Dan seems good. 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
He’‘s great. Very loyal. 

SENATOR HALLOWES (CONT'D) 
Got him from an Ohio Congresswoman. She 
was clearly going nowhere. You know he’s 
dating my daughter? 
SELINA 
Janet? 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
No. 

SELINA 
Sorry, of course not. I meant... 
Carol. Carol Hallowes. 
GARY 
I got you a double sleeve. Always err on 
the side of caution. And two sweeteners. 

SELINA 
So ~ you saw my letter inviting you on to 
the Clean Jobs Commission? It’s going to 
be big - my stamp on this administration. 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
Yes, I saw the letter. Anna forges your 
signature brilliantly. 
SELINA 
She does it so well sometimes I think I 
use her version of my signature when I 
sign my own name. Which I did. So why are 
you avoiding me? 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
Isn‘t it obvious? 
SELINA 
You seriously think plastics will pull 
funding over this? 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
What is plastic made of, Selina? You piss 
ey off plastic, you piss off oil. 
And I do not want to fuck with those 
guys. Because they fuck in a very 
unpleasant fashion. 
SELINA 
Jesus, does everything in this town have 
to come down to money? Why can’t we go 
back to the old days, when we just 
swapped land for beads? 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
Because, now we'd be controlled by the 
bead industry. I need to get going. 
DAN 
Nice bag Gary. 
ANNA 
He calls it ‘The Leviathan’. 
DAN 
You got the nuclear codes in there? 
GARY 
Ha, yes, you see, what I have in here may 
seem trivial but it is far from trivial. 
He takes out two small tins. 
GARY (CONT’D) 
See? Two types of lip salve - one is 
ordinary, everyday, regular salve. But if 
the Veep is in too many air-conditioned 
rooms her lips get radically dry, and she 
needs the heavy-duty stuff. Without it, 
she can‘t talk. Literally, it’s too 
painful for her to speak words. 
DAN 
And I guess if she can’t talk that could 
result in anything. Maybe war? 
GARY 
Very funny, Dan, but not so very far from 
the truth. I do a serious job. 
DAN 
And those guys who say you’re just an old 
man holding a lady's purse - screw them?

ANNA 
Dan - play nice. 
DAN 
Would you take a bullet for the VP? 
GARY 
Well, that’s the security guys. My job 
would be to help her when she’s down. 
Staunch the bleeding, get her painkillers 
and, you know... 
DAN 
Lip salve, right. In case she gets shot 
in the lips. 
ANNA 
Dan. Give me the ball. 
DAN 
But you’re the one constantly by her 
side, so if someone were to shoot at 
her...you know... 
GARY 
Okay... 
DAN 
You ready for that? Hot, fast metal 
ripping your internal organs apart. It 
ain‘t Shiatsu. 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
Oh, you know Senator Reeves died? 
SELINA 
Retard Reeves? He must have been...91? 
SENATOR HALLOWES 

SELINA 
He was the first Senator to welcome me to 
the Capitol. He was old even then. 
ANNA 
Was he full of wisdom?
SELINA 
He was full of Bourbon and he touched my 
left boob. 
ANNA 
God rest his soul. 
SENATOR HALLOWES 
Did you fire your tweeting guy? Because 
he is a weapons-grade retard. I think you 
might have been ‘hoist by your own 
retard’ there! 
Selina laughs. Senator Hallowes marches off. Dan lingers 
a bit. 
DAN 
By the way, I really admired your 
campaign, sorry you didn’t get the 
nomination. 

SELINA 
Thank you. I agree, I think we fought a 
good campaign. 
DAN 
Two things I would have done differently, 
but you’ve probably been over those with 
Anna. 
SELINA 
Two things? What were they? 
DAN 
Shouldn‘t have spent so much time in New 
Hampshire, that was in the bag, and 
attack ads in Oregon were four days too 
early, it looked like you were mean 
before you had to be. But look, I'm 
teaching my grandmother to suck eggs 
here. 
Mother...big sister to suck eggs. 
SELINA 
Interesting. Good to meet you Dan. 
Selina and Gary head off. 
DAN 
See you at the fundraiser.

ANNA 
Yup, don’t forget your ‘plus one’. 
DAN 
Yup, plus one. 

ANNA 
=
So, did the Senator take the Clean Jobs 
post? 
SELINA 

What do you think of Dan? 
ANNA 
Dan is a shit. 
SELINA 
Okay, want to expand on that? 
ANNA 
He’s a massive and total shit. When you 
first meet him, you think, surely to God 
this man can’t be as big a shit as he 
seems. But he is. 
SELINA 
See, I... 
ANNA 
It’s like, if you were to see a book with 
covers made of shit, you'd think, that’s 
intriguing. I wonder what's in this book 
that they saw fit to give it covers made 
of pure shit. Then you open it and - 
shit. 
SELINA 
I think he’s OK. I think we could use him 
for...let’s just say, I think Senator 
Hallowes has made herself a very powerful 
enemy. 
ANNA 
Who?

SELINA 
Me! 
ANNA 
Yes, you. Of course. 
GARY 
Absolutely, you. 
SELINA 
I’m the powerful enemy. 
ANNA 
Hey Mike - off to give the 3:30? 
MIKE 
Yeah. I heard about the cutleryfuck at 
the Capitol. Thanks everyone. 
ANNA 
Yeah, go polish that turd, Mike. 
MIKE 
And the plastic guy - what do you plan to 
say to him? 
SELINA 
Okay, well I guess my main... 
MIKE 
Actually, don’t tell me. If I genuinely 
don‘t know, the bastards can’t make me 
tell them. You know my motto: “I Don’t 
Want To Know And Anyway What Motto, I 
Have No Motto.” 
SELINA 
Jonah. 
JONAH 
Madam Vice President. 
ANNA 
I know you only do that to look cool and 
get the giris. 
MIKE 
You look like the guy from My Left Foot. 
Selina goes through into her private office. 
JONAH 
The President lets me smoke out of the 
White House briefing room window, and 
that opens the whole way. 
GARY 
That one’s an anti-suicide window. 
JONAH 
They only put it in when you joined, 
right Gary? 
GARY 
No. 
ANNA 
How many times have you spoken to the 
President today, Jonah? You need to 
remember so you can put it up on your 
star chart on the refrigerator. 
JONAH 
Four times. In the briefing room, in the 
hallway, NSC meeting, in the hallway 
again. 
MIKE 
Is that as he was trying to throw you out 
of the NSC meeting? 
JONAH 
The President knows my name Mike. I doubt 
he remembers yours. 
ANNA 
You know he attaches an image to a name 
to make it easier to remember? 
So for you - Jonah - he’d think of a 
whale, because you’re called Jonah and 
you look like a whale. 
JONAH 
So, Anna, good new Italian place opened 
downtown. You like Italian? 
ANNA 
I love Italian Jonah. But still, 
unfortunately, really dislike you. 
JONAH 
Hey, I'm not asking you out. That wasn’t 
a knockback because I didn’t ask you out. 
ANNA 
Jonah, you know I will never go out with 
you. I would rather go out with Gary than 
go out with you and I would never in a 
million years go out with Gary. Isn’t 
that right, Gary? 
GARY 
Right. You’ve said this many a time. 

SELINA 
Jonah, you are, I know, a very busy and 
important 24-year-old. So why have you 
come to see us? 
JONAH 
The White House would like you to go to 
tonight’s SRVA fundraiser instead of the 
President. 
SELINA 
Why? 
JONAH 
He‘d rather not be open to questioning 
tonight. Frank's remarks about off-shore 
accounts and curbing business tax breaks 
were obviously absolutely correct, but he 
will be resigning tomorrow. 
Pharmaceuticals and the Roundtable are 
flapping, we need to throw them a 
cuttlefish.
SELINA 
Apt food metaphor, given there’s no 
backbone involved. Sorry, Jonah, I'd love 
to go up there and publicly contradict my 
beliefs, but I have my own agenda space 
to tend to. 
JONAH 
The President is very keen that your 
going to the fundraiser should be, 
fundamentally, the sequence of events 
that does actually take place this 
evening. 
Selina has no option. 
SELINA 
Let me make a cail. 

JONAH 
You need to be there too Mike, so no 
going home to walk the dog. Make sure the 
VP doesn’t mention cornstarch, plastics, 
fossil fuels or any type of organic or 
inorganic compound whatsoever. 
MIKE 
Don‘t tell me what to do, Doogie fucking 
Howzer. 
JONAH 
I don’t know what that means. Or the left- 
foot thing. And I can fucking tell you 
what to do because one of us backed the 
winning candidate in the Presidential 
nominations. 

Let me text you the name of that someone 
who does now work for the President... 
and not for the candidate who lost. 

MIKE 
‘Jungle’. 
JONAH 
Jonah. It’s predictive text. You know 
what I wrote. I wrote my name. 
MIKE 
Okay Jungle. 
SELINA 
Right, I’ve cancelled my date. Anna, we 
should get a speech and some jokes 
together. 
JONAH 
Jokes? 
SELINA 
Just some gags to liven things up. Anna 
will come up with some. 
ANNA 
Maybe not jokes as such. Maybe more a 
light touch. Like Ugly Betty - it’s not 
technically a comedy, but it has a light 
touch. 
JONAH 
No, no jokes. These are not humorous 
times for America. 
Jonah leaves. 
SELINA 
You know, I’m wondering just how hard 
I’ll weep when that guy gets his 
embolism. 
ANNA 
Okay, let’s turn this - use tonight's 
speech for your ‘Re-energizing Floor 
Procedure’ agenda. 
SELINA 
Right. Let‘s float my idea about cloture 
change needing 41 to prevent instead of 
60 to invoke. 
ANNA 
You don’t seriously expect me to come up 
with jokes about that? 
Mike heads out. 
MIKE 
I‘ll go and check if the press room's 
ready for the fireball about to hit them. 
SELINA 
Mike - what were my two big campaign 
Mistakes, would you say? 
MIKE 
You looked tired a lot of the time? And 
that hat?
SELINA 
You don’t think one of them was that we 
went too soon with attack ads in Oregon? 
MIKE 
Who knows about that shit? Anyway, we got 
here in the end. 
ANNA 
Okay, Senator Clements is here, you 
should definitely talk to her. And Bill 
Knight from the Speaker's office. 
MIKE 
Ooch, little burgers. Great. Four of those 
make a normal one. 
ANNA 
I assume you’re taking some of those home 
for your dog? 
SELINA 
What utensils do they have here? I can’t 
be seen using cornstarch over plastic. Or 
plastic over cornstarch. 
MIKE 
You could use celery as a kind of shovel? 
SELINA 
Bring me some lentil salad, I’11 go in 
the corner and eat it with my fingers. 
GARY 
I expect this is a fairly low-risk event, 
yeah? All-ticket affair? 
WOMAN 
Pretty much. There’s usually one or two 
unknowns.

GARY 
Unknowns? 
WOMAN 
You guys with Kate? 
The men nod. 
WOMAN (CONT’D) 
Okay. 
You’re not terrorists are you, ‘cos Kate 
knows a lot of terrorists! 
MIKE 
They deliberately don’t give you a plate 
at these things to discourage you from 
getting a free dinner. But I always say - 
the forearm is nature's plate. 

MIKE (CONT'D) 
By the way, I’m Mike. 
SELINA 
Do you have my notes Anna? 
ANNA 
Gary has them. 

SELINA 
Notes please Gary. 
SELINA (CONT’D) 
Gary? 
GARY 
Sorry ma’am - do you need me? 
SELINA 
I need my notes. Why are you over there? 
MIKE 
Take a hike kid. 
LITTLE GIRL 
I’m sorry sir? 
MIKE 
Take a hike. Defcon one. 
SELINA 
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen... 

---and Tom! 

SELINA (CONT'D) 
Aaahm. These are serious times. And in 
serious times we require an effective 
legislature. I’m reminded tonight of the 
late Senator David Reeves... 
SELINA (CONT’D) 
He died. He’s dead now. And I remember 
him talking to me about the absurdity of 
allowing multiple filibusters on a single 
bill. In his words... 
JONAH 
This isn’t quite the Gettysburg Address. 
DAN 
It’s more a recreation of the tragic 
events that led to it. 
ANNA 
Could you two shut your mouths? 
It's that red and yellow hole you use 
when you sieve carbohydrates through your 
pubey 15-year-old’s beard. 
JONAH 
I‘m sorry. Are you having difficulty 
hearing the other 200 people talking over 
your boss? 
JONAH (CONT'D) 
That your date? 
DAN 
That’s the woman I’m with tonight, yes. 
JONAH 
She's nice. An eight. Definite eight. I 
used to get sixes, now I’m in the White 
House I get eights. 
DAN 
I’ve never seen you with an eight. 
JONAH 
Oh, I get eights, believe me. I’m up to 
my neatly trimmed nuts in eights... 
DAN 
So, who do you know? 
ANNA 
Carol Hallowes? How do you even say that? 
Carol Hallowes. “Hallo Carol Hallowes!” 
DAN 
You know I did promise her she'd be three 
feet away from the President tonight.
ANNA 
What a shame - she’s going to have to be 
content with being, what? 

...three and a half inches away from you 
later? 
DAN 
That doesn’t work. As a joke. The penis, 
whatever size, is inserted into the 
vagina. So she would be the same distance 
from me if my penis were small or huge. 

ANNA 
Hallo Carol Hallowes! 
CUT TO: 
Selina’s still speaking. 
SELINA 
With a Senate logjam like we currently 
have, hundreds of bills are getting 
stalled, which means millions... 
JONAH 
What are you doing? 
ANNA 
I'm giving her the signal to make a joke. 
JONAH 
Don’t, she’s in enough trouble. 
ANNA 
Get your hand off me you freak! 

ANNA (CONT'D) 
And don’t tell people you got to first 
base with me, because that wasn’t first 
base. That was assault. 

SELINA 
So, I’ll let you all get back to enjoying 
yourselves. 
Actually talking of enjoyment, and 
leisure, I just booked a holiday in 
Florida. Wonder if that makes me the 
Miami Vice President!? Or... 
Okay, thank you for listening and... 
HECKLER 
You going to be tweeting about this? 
SELINA 
Ha! If that’s a reference to the rogue 
cutlery tweet - I'm afraid that there we 
were very much ‘hoist by our own retard’! 
Thank you so much. 
SELINA (CONT'D) 
Do people not listen any more? So rude. 
ANNA 
Ma’‘am...the last remark you made... 
DAN 
The word ‘retard’. 
SELINA 
It's not that bad a word, is it? 
ANNA 
It will be deemed offensive to anyone 
with learning difficulties. Yes ma‘am. 
DAN 
This will soon be getting on the blogs. 
SELINA 
What? Shit - how? I just said it like a 
second ago. Fuck broadband. 
ANNA 
Ma‘am, the President of AT&T is in the 
room. 

ANNA (CONT'D) 
Mike, put the crabcakes down, we have a 
situation with the Vice President.
MIKE 
A situation with the Vice President? 
GARY 
Oh God! Is she down? I should have been 
there! 
SELINA 
This is not my fault. 
DAN 
I can’t access Kagan’s blog. Is it down? 
ANNA 
No, not your fault ma’am. I can’t access 
Kagan either. Someone punch the AT&T guy. 
SELINA 
This is your boss. She was using that 
word so much this morning ~ ‘retard’ 
this, ‘retard’ the other - it was like 
Hurricane Retard. It fixed it in my head. 
DAN 
There’s a way to mend this. Tomorrow 
morning you meet with someone amenable 
from a mental health charity. I have a 
lot of contacts. 
SELINA 
I imagine you probably do. You're a hub. 
A nexus the size of Texas. Talk to Anna. 

ANNA 
Appreciate your input Dan but fuck off. 
She needs to call the Association of 
Mental Health Charities right now, not 
tomorrow, and apologise.
DAN 
No! Calm things down. More haste, less 
speed. 
ANNA 
The way I see it, more haste, more haste. 
We need haste here. 
DAN 
Larry, Moe - let Curly in first. 
SELINA 
Yes, that’s right, so I was wanting to 
apologise over some comments that I...uh- 
huh, sure, I'll hold. 

I‘m holding. Actually, what if they 
haven't heard about it yet. What if the 
mental people haven’t heard the retard 
comments? 
ANNA 
Well, they will hear eventually so... 
SELINA 
You think they'll definitely hear? 
MIKE 
They might not hear. What if Tom Hanks 
dies? 
ANNA 
What? 
MIKE 
Just a for-instance - what if Tom Hanks 
dies? That’s all that will be on the news 
for like a week. 
SELINA 
He‘s right, they’1l be going with the 
cutlery thing tomorrow. Plastics is worse 
than retard. I think it’s worse. Is it? 
Fuck, I don’t know any more. Should I 
hang up? 

MIKE 
Okay, how about - we let the retard thing 
blow up. It was a silly word, we 
apologise, but it’s the main story, so 
we've drowned out plastics? 
ANNA 
Mike, the press didn’t stop writing about 
Hiroshima just because the Nagasaki thing 
blew up. 
GARY 
Codeine or Ibuprofen? 
SELINA 
Both. Plus that stuff they use in lethal 
injections. 
Yes, hi, just one second... 
They've de-held me, I’m loose, I’ve gone 
rogue. What do I say? 

SELINA (CONT'D) 

Yes, hi, I was mentioning to your 
colleague, what happened was I used the 
word ‘retard’ in a...retard, yes. In a 
humorous context. No, I know, that is why 
I‘m apologising now.... 
ANNA 
I think we‘re going to need you to puil 
an all-nighter on this Mike. 
MIKE 
I can’t. The dog. 
SELINA 
Go home. Feed the dog. Walk the dog. 
Shoot the dog. Bury the dog. Come back 
in. 
MIKE 
Actually, maybe...the dog will be fine. 
MIKE 
It was a reference to a petard. No, not 
Star Trek - ‘petard’. 

ANNA 
Okay, set up new Google alerts for ‘VP.’ 
‘Meyer offensive’, ‘Meyer retard’, ‘Meyer 
resigning issue’. Then delete your 
History. 

JONAH 
Okay, why the huge retard panic? The 
retard thing's not as bad as cutlery. 
ANNA 
The Veep apologised last night about the 
retard thing. 
JONAH 
What? She put it out there? Okay, here’s 
a couple more News Alerts for you then: 
try ‘VP worse than the Jonestown 
massacre’ and ‘VP 9/11 point 2'. 
ANNA 
I haven’t got time to ignore you Jonah. 
Gary, could you ignore Jonah for me? 
GARY 
I assume you're joking Anna. Hi Jonah. 
What do you have there? 

JONAH 
Condolence card, for Senator Reeves’ 
widow. The President's already signed, so 
if Selina could too, while she still has 
a job? Then I’11l send it round the Hill. 

DAN 
Anna, this is Paul Burton, Chair of the 
American Association of Mental Health 
Charities. 
PAUL 
Hi.

SELINA 
Mr Burton. Why don’t you come through to 
my office. Gary, could you fix some 
coffee? 
GARY 
Yes ma’am. 

JONAH 
Ma‘am, I have a condolence card here for 
Senator Reeves’ widow... 
ANNA 
What was that gesture? I’ve never seen 
her give that gesture. 

JONAH 
Is she not going to sign this card? 
ANNA 
I’ll sign the card. That’s what her 
gesture was to me, to do her signature on 
this. What was her gesture to you Dan? 
DAN 
I’m not sure I noticed a gesture. 

ANNA 
Can you not stand so close Jonah, you 
stink of cigarettes. 
JONAH 
I smell like a man. All men used to smell 
like this. Spencer Tracy used to smell 
like this. Cary Grant. I smell like them. 
DAN 
Dead old men. 
Gary emerges from Selina‘s office. 
JONAH 
You all smell of women, especially you 
Gary.


GARY 
That’ll be the VP’s scented wipes. 
Vanilla and rose. 
ANNA 
I know what you’re doing Dan, okay? 
DAN 
Yes? What am I doing? 
ANNA 
I don't know, exactly, but I do know that 
you are one sly fuck. You know Fantastic 
Mr Fox? That’s you, only you're worse 
than a fox. You’re Fantastic Mr Shit. 
JONAH 
Sorry to interrupt the pre-nup, but is 
this card going to...? 

ANNA 
I’m signing the fucking card. 
MIKE 
Hit the deck, fuckers! Brett Kagan's blog 
is now saying the VP was calling Senator 
Reeves a retard at the fundraiser. 
DAN 
Well, see, that’s Kagan getting things 
completely wrong. We can prove the VP 
didn't say that and discredit him. Which 
is why I planted that story with him in 
the first place. 
ANNA /MIKE 
What the fuck...? 
DAN 
It’s a dumb story anyway, and we also 
show it’s unreliable, because it comes 
from a blogger who’s a news slut. He 
shuts down, cutlery moves to page 10, 
retard moves to page 5,and on page 1 we 
have “Bloggers Eat Babies”. 
GARY 
I don’t understand. Are you meant to be 
clever?

DAN 
It’s brilliant Gary. And it gets better. 
What you need to do, Mikey, at the 11:30 
press call today is make it clear there 
were two people - the VP and Senator 
Hallowes - involved in Retardgate. 
GARY 
Can we not call it Retardgate? Can we 
call it the R-word F-up? 

DAN 
I don't give a splayed fucking anus what 
the fuck we call it you clumsy fucking 
human tumour, we‘ve got to deal with it, 
okay? Now get on board, or I swear I'll 
slice your tits off so Mike can take them 
home for his dog. We need a body. And we 
can’t give them the Vice President. 
MIKE 
So we give them your boss? Are you doing 
a thing, a clever double thing, or...? 
DAN 
Don’t worry your meaty head, Mike, just 
tell the press that Senator Hallowes 
introduced the expression ‘retard’ into 
the conversation. And she encouraged - 
strike - she goaded the VP into using it. 
MIKE 
You think I’m going to do what you say? 
Dan gets very close to Mike. 
DAN 
Ask yourself - do you think I‘1l end up 
working in a position above you or below 
you Mike? Every shred of ambition left 
your body a long time ago and all you’ve 
got left for the remaining 10 years of 
your working life is a damp apartment, 
cold dwarf-burgers from a buffet, and an 
invisible fucking dog. Make a 
calculation. 
GARY 
Oh, could you sign this customs form to 
confirm that Selina’s French sweeteners 
weren't a gift? Not, if you will, a 
‘sweetener’.

ANNA 
You, Gary, are as funny as...fuck. 
GARY 
Why thank you. 
ANNA 
No. Fuck. The condolence card. I think I 
signed my own name. Not Selina’s, mine. 
GARY 
How sure are you, on a scale of one to 
ten, where one... 
ANNA 
I can work out how the fucking scale will 
go Gary. Nine. I’m nine sure that I 
signed my name. 
GARY 
Nine. That’s almost the full ten. 
ANNA 
Okay. Not good. The VP couldn't be 
bothered to sign a card for one of the 
most revered Senators of the last 50 
years. Selina can’t know about this. 
GARY 
No. 
ANNA 
Gary...! 
GARY 
If she’s going down, I’ve got to catch 
her. 
ANNA 
Why did you tell her? You lunatic. She’s 
going to turn into an apeshit crazy 
person. 
SELINA
SELINA (CONT’D) 
This is insane. We've done Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki. We're doing Chernobyl as well? 
ANNA 
I'm so sorry. I .. 
SELINA 
I need every Senator on side to get 
reform through and you give me this? 
Senator's are fucking prickly people, 
Anna. I know. I used to be a big fucking 
prickly Senator. 
ANNA 
I'm so sorry. We’ll get the card back. 
SELINA 
Yes you will. Now get on with it, because 
I‘m busy in there apologising. 

SELINA (CONT'D) 
Sorry, how where... 

ANNA 
Mike, a truckload of fuck has just been 
unloaded all over this office. 
MIKE 
Man, this is too much information. 
MIKE 
I need you to know I’m not happy about 
giving this briefing. 
DAN 
And I need you to know that I couldn't 
give a shit.

MIKE 
Is this going to be like Moonlighting 
where we end up falling in love with each 
other and fucking? 
DAN 
No, more like The Wire, where I end up 
blowing your brains out. And then like 
Dexter, where I cut you into little 
pieces and incinerate you. And then like 
The West Wing, where I become President. 
GARY 
I’m feeling a bit like, you know, the 
Watergate burglars? I mean, this is... 
ANNA 
Don’t be a dick Gary. With Watergate they 
burgled party secrets, you're retrieving 
a greetings card. OK? They forced illegal 
entry, you have a pass that authorises 
you to enter most of the White House. 
SELINA 
This isn’t Watergate. This is walking 
through a gate. 
GARY 
I need a long coat. To hide the card. 
ANNA 
You can borrow mine. 
SELINA 
Good luck Gary - take that bullet for me! 
JONAH 
Gary. 
GARY 
Jesus! Jonah! Hi. 
JONAH 
You're in my office. 
GARY 
Yes. 
JONAH 
What do you want? In my office. 
GARY 
Nothing at all. Just...I needed to see... 
JONAH 
Are you here to steal the card, Gary? 
GARY 
No sir, not at all. 
JONAH 
This looks bad Gary. This looks real bad. 
And I’m a friend of yours. 
GARY 
But it isn’t bad. I’m not bad. 
JONAH 
I knew the card had been incorrectly 
signed. But I didn’t say anything because 
I wanted to use this knowledge for my 
personal advantage. 
GARY 
Right. 
JONAH 
I will give you the card Gary. With 
pleasure. 
GARY 
Thank you. Please get to the bad bit of 
this because I know there’ll be one and I 
don't like tension. I have acid reflux 
issues. 
JONAH 
I want Anna to go on a date with me 
tonight. We won’t have sex, because she 
hates me. But Anna is an eight, and if 
the other eights I want to have sex with 
see I’m eight-capable, then I will have 
some sex with an eight before too long.
GARY 
I'm sorry, but do I look like a pimp? 

JONAH 
You kind of do. 
DAN 
We've all said dumb things in our lives. 
But I certainly don’t think this is a 
resigning issue for Senator Hallowes. 
Okay. Goodbye. 
Hi, Carol Hallowes please. 

O “Carol Hallowes”. Yes, voicemail, thanks. 

Carol, it’s Dan. I don’t really know how 
to say this... 

-.-but I don’t think, right now, I'm 
ready to take that next step that we need 
to take as a couple ... 

..-l mean, really, this is killing me, 
this decision. Jesus. I’m not eating... 

...it’s tearing me up. 
Plus, you have a stupid fucking name. 
DAN 
Hey, big guy. Looks like Operation 
Terrified Old Man went well.
GARY 
Jonah caught me. I had to make a deal. 

ANNA 
No she fucking isn’t. 
GARY 
He doesn’t want to sleep with you, just 
dinner and a movie. 
DAN 
A date with stinky Jonah. Lucky you. 
You’re getting him in his prime, before 
next year's heart-lung transplant. 
ANNA 
I‘m not going out with Jonah. 
SELINA 
Get a grip. It’s one date with no sex. 
For me that was 12 years of marriage. 
Okay, let me sign this thing. This has 
gone from being a resigning issue, to a 
‘re-signing’ issue. That’s a very clever 
orthographic joke. 
SELINA (CONT’D) 
Shit. 
ANNA 
Shit. 
SELINA 
The President already signed. We need to 
forge the President's signature as well. 
GARY 
Isn‘t that still a capital offence? Can't 
you be electrocuted for that? 

DAN 
I‘ll do it. The key is to do it upside 
down. 
SELINA 
Wow. Dan - thank you. Is there anything 
you can’t do? 
C) ANNA 
Foreplay. Empathy. 
DAN 
Oh, and Senator Hallowes has let it be 
known that she will not be putting her 
name forward to replace the Chair of the 
Finance Committee. 
SELINA 
Who's the baadass? Gary? 
GARY 
You are, Madam Vice President. 
DAN 
She also added she'll be taking a less 
public role in future. So... 
ANNA 
Checking the mirror. 
DAN 
I guess that leaves me with a fatally 
injured boss. 
ANNA 
Signalling. 
DAN 
And I wondered if there might be a 
position in this office? 
ANNA 
And we’re moving off. Careful, you hit a 
toddler. 
SELINA 
We should talk. I was thinking I'd like 
to create a Special Director of 
Communications role within this 
department. 
DAN 
Uh-huh? Interesting. 

ANNA 
Excuse me - you just hired him? You hired 
the biggest bastard in DC? 
SELINA 
I’m fluent in bastard. It’s one of my 
languages. Don’t worry about me.
 
ANNA 
You? I’m worried about me. I've worked 
for you for nine years. I have... 
SELINA 
And I haven’t done anything for you? You 
happen to be standing in the office of 
the Vice President of the United States 
young lady. I think that’s pretty good. 
ANNA 
“Young lady”? 
SELINA 
I used Dan to get what I wanted. 
ANNA 
No, he used you to get what he wanted. 
SELINA 
No, I definitely used him. I’m the u-ser, 
he‘s the u-see. That's right, isn’t it? 
ANNA 
Does he look used? 

DAN 
Nice desk, Gary. 

MIKE 
Duck and cover, everyone. This is the 
front page of tomorrow’s Post. 
JONAH 
I just saw that - nice teeth. Madam Vice 
President, you'll be relieved to hear the 
President has decided to subsume the 
Clean Jobs Commission into the DOE... 
SELINA 
He's done what?! 
JONAH 
-.-thus leaving you free to apply your 
unique talents to other fields of 
interest.
 
SELINA 
Such as? 
JONAH 
The Mars Project? 
SELINA 
Great, that sounds like something 
achievable in the next month. Get the 
fuck out of here, little boy, before I 
confiscate your prostate. 
JONAH 
Come on then Anna, shrimp linguine and a 
porno. I’m joking. It’s chicken linguine. 
Anna and Jonah leave. 
ANNA 
Touch me at this restaurant and you will 
get metal cutlery in your eyes. 
SELINA 
You know Mike - who’d have thought that 
if you Tweet about cutlery and call a 
dead senator a retard, it’s the cutlery 
that comes to bite you? 
MIKE 
Reeves was a retard anyway. 
SELINA 
Yep. And, at least four times in his 
distinguished Senate career, a rapist. 
ANNA (0.S.) 
Sorry ma’am, forgot to brief you. This is 
Ken Nichol of the Plastics & Cellulose 
Association. I'd booked him in for a four 
o'clock. 

SELINA 
Mr Nichol. 
Gary! Coffee! And two fucking sugars.
