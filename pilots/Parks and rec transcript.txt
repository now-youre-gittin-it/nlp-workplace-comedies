LESLIE (V.0.) 
I love politics. I've always loved 
politics. "The game." 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
Some people say that politics is show 
business for ugly people. I disagree. 
It's show business for real people -- 
people whose talents aren't dancing and 
singing, but rather talking and talking. 
LESLIE (V.0.) 
I just...I love the majesty of the 
political system. I live for it. I 
would say that my greatest dream is to be 
elected President of the United States of 
America. 
LESLIE 
My name is Leslie Knope. And I am the 
Deputy Chairwoman of the Department of 
Parks and Recreation in the city of 
Pawnee, Indiana. 

LESLIE (CONT'D) 
Can you get wide enough to see the flag? 
RON 
Internal Auditing wants to remind all 
government employees that any gift given 
by a member of the public valued at over 
$25 has to be reported immediately. 
EMPLOYEE 
Ron, what about, like, a gift 
certificate? Would that count? 
RON 
How much? 
EMPLOYEE 
Two hundred dollars. 
• RON 
(yes, dummy) 
...Yes. That would count. You can't win, just 
report it and add to the endless red tape. 
LESLIE 
Of course report it! 
(off their looks) 
It's the smart play. The last thing we need is the 
press breathing down our neck. Am I right, Ron? I 
am agreeing with you.  
RON 
Lastly, tonight is the Community Outreach Public 
Forum. Leslie's gonna run it. 
RON (CONT'D)  
We need one more. Who wants in? 
• RON (CONT'D) 
Tom.
TOM 
Ugh. Fine. 
LESLIE 
Every month the city government holds a 
public forum and every month, out of over 
600 city workers, I'm the one they send. 
(shrugging) 
It's pretty cool. Whatever. No big 
deal. Just an honor. 
RON 
No one else wants to do it. It's a 
terrible job, going to some dingy rec 
center and getting yelled at by the 
public. I hate the public. The public 
is stupid. 
LESLIE 
This'll be really good for you guys to 
see. This is where the rubber of 
government meets the road of actual human 
beings. When I go through those doors, I 
have to be on, like the White House Press 
Secretary. So. Deep breath. 
Let's rock and roll. 

LESLIE 
Thank you all for coming. My name is 
Parks Department Deputy Chairwoman Leslie 
Knope. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
With me today is department member Tom 
Haverford. 
TOM TALKING HEAD 
TOM 
Yes, when I was 18 I changed my name from 
Aziz Abdul A1'Rahman to Tom Haverford. 
The cold hard fact is that dark-skinned 
people with funny-sounding Muslim names 
just don't make it very far in politics. 
(jump cut) 
Yes, okay, fine, Barack Obama. Why does 
everyone always bring up Barack Obama? 
That's one counter-example! 
LESLIE (V.0.) 
And yes, I do call myself a "Deputy 
Chairwoman." Politics is changing in 
this country -- it's not just a boys club 
anymore. There are 18 million cracks in 
the glass ceiling, thanks to people like 
me, and Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, 
and, um... Margaret Thatcher. And Nancy 
Pelosi. The Parks Department is the site 
of another one of those cracks. 
And over the course of my political 
career, I intend to go around making 
thousands of more cracks in things, if 
not outright shattering and destroying 
them. 
LESLIE (CONT'D)  
Big turnout tonight! Very exciting. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
So fire away! Yes? 
MAN 
I am here because of a crime that is 
happening right now all over this city, 
that you people know about and do nothing 
to stop. 
LESLIE 
That's horrible. 
MAN 
Will you commit right now to helping me 
stop this crime? 
LESLIE 
Absolutely. We want to serve you in any 
way we can. 
MAN 
Do you want me to tell you what the crime 
is? 
LESLIE 
Yes. Please, tell me, so I can help you 
stop it. I don't understand why you're 
being so mysterious about this. 
MAN 
It's abortion. 
TOM  
Abortion's legal, dude. 
MAN 
You promised to stop it. 
(holds up mini recorder) I 
have it on tape! 
LESLIE 
Sir, first of all, that was a really mean 
trap. But more importantly, the city 
government doesn't have the ability to 
overturn a Supreme Court decision-- 
MAN 
I think you could, if you weren't so 
lazy. Mayor Havlicek could. 
LESLIE 
Mayor Havlicek was mayor when I was a 
kid. He was quite an old-school 
character. 
LESLIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) 
He might have been able to overturn a 
Supreme Court ruling. He died in a small 
plane accident when he was thrown out in 
handcuffs at 20,000 feet. 
ANN 
Um...I have -- 
OTHER MAN 
When they gonna open up Ramsett Park  
again? It's been closed for a year. 
LESLIE 
• Yes, we are trying hard to get that park 
reopened. There was a new problem 
recently...what was it, Tom? 
TOM 
Angry dogs. 
LESLIE 
Dogs. That's right. There was a pack of 
scary dogs who were attacking the park 
workers, and we said, unh unh. Read our 
lips. "Dogs can't bite people!" 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
So we are looking into the problem. 
Who's next? 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
Yes, Barry, go ahead. 
BARRY 
Well, well, well -- today is a great day! 
Because last month they put me in jail. 
That's right! And my mother had a 
restaurant in this town. A creamery. The 
head of the police is a ninth degree 
 mason. 
TOM TALKING HEAD 
TOM 
There are a few regulars who always show 
up to our meetings and ramble on about 
stuff. Leslie says we should listen to 
them like we'd listen to anyone else. I 
prefer: mocking them. 
BARRY 
One day there was a fire. And that's 
what killed my snake. Now I have a few 
things to say about Laura Linney. 
LESLIE 
Okay, Barry, thank you. 
TOM 
No, no, I want to hear what he has to say 
about Laura Linney. 

BARRY 
Laura Linney is a fifteenth degree mason. 
In the fifteenth degree they teach you 
how to talk with your mouth closed. 
LESLIE 
Okay, thank you, Barry. Thank you for 
your comments. 
TOM 
I agree with a lot of what he said. 
LESLIE 
This is valuable. Citizen comments. 
Who's next? 
ANN 
Hi. So, I'm Ann Logan, and a few of us 
are here to talk about the abandoned lot 
on Sullivan Street. 
LESLIE 
Alright. Go on. 
ANN 
I'm a nurse, and frankly I'm not at all 
interested in politics. 
ANN (CONT'D) 
But this thing almost killed my 
boyfriend, so... 
Anyway, on this lot near my house, a 
developer dug out a basement for an 
office building, and then they went 
bankrupt. And now, there's just...this 
giant pit. 
ANN (V.0.) (CONT'D) 
It's been there almost a year. 
LESLIE (V.0.) 
Twelve months, yes, go on. 
ANN (V.0.) 
It goes right up to the backyard of the 
house I rent. 
ANN 
And my boyfriend -- who's a musician 
actually, who I support, but who was 
really starting to make some contacts and 
apply himself in the music business -- 
anyway, he was cutting through the lot at 
night, and it was raining, and he just -- 
whoomp! -- fell right in. Broke both his 
legs. 
ANDY 
It was slippery. Did she tell you it was 
slippery? Because it was super slippery. 
ANN 
There was a little item in the paper. 
"Unemployed man breaks legs in abandoned 
pit." Which -- why do they have to say 
"unemployed" man? That is inappropriate 
editorializing that doesn't belong in a 
news piece, in my opinion. 
LESLIE 
It's the gotcha media. 
ANN 
The point is, there's a giant hole in the 
ground and people are falling in. I've 
been trying for months to get someone to 
fix this problem -- I've written letters, 
and I've made like a thousand phone calls 
to the government, but so far... 
She makes a zero with her fingers. 
TOM 
Who fell in again? Your boyfriend? 
 • Yeah. ANN 
TOM 
Is he dead? 
ANN 
No. But he broke his legs. 
TOM 
Uh huh. How long you guys been together? 
Is it a strong relationship? 
TOM (CONT'D) 
I'm not hitting on you. I'm married. 
am only asking for background purposes. 
MARGARET 
We've been to the Revenue Collection 
department, and the Transportation 
Department, and the City Manager, and we 
keep hitting dead ends. 
LESLIE 
I'm sorry to hear that, but this doesn't 
seem like a government problem-- 
ANN 
Actually it is, because the government 
owns the land now. So you're going to 
have to figure out a different way to 
blow me off. 
LESLIE 
Well, guess what? I'm not going to blow 
you off. 
ANN 
(unconvinced) 
Really. 
LESLIE 
Yes. I will help you. 
ANN 
Is that a promise? 
LESLIE 
More than a promise. A pinky promise. I 
pinky promise all of you, right now, that 
I will help. And not only will we fill in 
that pit, but we will put a beautiful new 
park on that land. 
TOM 
What the hell are you doing? 
LESLIE 
I'm getting in the game. 
ANN 
She claims she's going to help us. 
Whatever. Frankly she seems like kind of 
a simpleton. 

LESLIE 
I've been in the parks department for six 
years, and until now I've only really 
been able to engage in park maintenance. 
For example, last year I led the city- 
wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand 
after those problems with the cats. I 
heard some testimony from mothers of 
toddlers that would make you cry. But 
this pit! The chance to build a new 
park, from scratch... 
This is my Hoover Dam. 

TOM 
That sounds great. Problem is, anything 
over 25 dollars I have to report. So just 
call my wife and give her the suits and 
then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll 
give them to me. 
LESLIE 
Hey Tom. 
TOM 
Alright Mr. Mayor. Nice talking with ya. 
Leslie! Hello. 
LESLIE 
That was the mayor? 
TOM 
Yeah. We were just rapping about some 
things. 
LESLIE TALKING HEAD 
LESLIE 
Tom is so lucky. I need to make the 
acquaintance of the mayor. 
TOM TALKING HEAD 
TOM 
I swear to God she is the most gullible 
human being I've ever met in my life. 
LESLIE 
Brainstorm. How do I make this happen? 
TOM 
Go to the City Council directly, ask them 
to just front the money. 

LESLIE 
Nah, money's tight right now. Parks 
aren't a priority. I need more 
firepower. I need some bigger guns. 
Tom looks at her chest and snickers. 
TOM 
Yeah. Your guns are pretty small. 
LESLIE 
Tell me about it. 

LESLIE 
Tom and I work great together. We're 
both outsiders -- me as a woman, him 
as... whatever he is. I wanna say... 
Libyan? Plus he's the size of a child. 
Size twenty-eight waist. Plus he 
worships the prophet Mahomet. 

TOM 
Tom Haverford c'mon, I'm Episcopalian. 
Three years now. 
LESLIE 
Well, obviously, what I really need is to 
establish a committee. 
(to camera) 
Committees are power. They are the 
lifeblood of the democratic system. 
(to Tom) 
That was good. Did you get that? For 
the book? 
TOM 
Yup. Got it. 
LESLIE 
(to camera) 
• From time to time, I stumble upon a 
saying, or a phrase, that really sums up 
my feelings about things. Tom is helping 
me collect them, for my memoirs. 

TOM TALKING HEAD 
TOM 
No I'm not. 
LESLIE 
What if we got Mark on board? 
TOM 
Mark who? 
LESLIE  
"Mark who?!" Brendanawicz! 
TOM 
Oh. Sure. Whatever. Call him. 
LESLIE 
You want something done in this town, you 
need Mark Brendanawicz. He's a city 
planner and he's "da bomb." Smart, 
capable, knows where all the bodies are 
buried. Just a great, solid, smart, big, 
strapping, solid guy. 
TOM 
She wants to bone him so bad. 
LESLIE 
What? 
(into phone) 
Hey! Mark! 
MARK 
Hey Leslie. 

LESLIE 
What's up, Brendanawicz, you crazy ol' 
Polack? 
LESLIE 
Politics is rough-and-tumble. Yes, I'm a 
woman, but to fit in I sometimes have to 
talk like a man, act like a man. You 
have to dish it out and you have to take 
it. 

MARK 
"Crazy (31' Polack?" What the hell, 
Leslie? That's really hurtful. 
LESLIE 
(crumbling) 
Oh my God. Mark, I'm so sorry. I'm just 
trying to kid around. Oh God. Oh God, 
I've already screwed it all up. 
MARK 
Leslie. I'm kidding. 
LESLIE 
What? Ha ha ha ha! I know. He he he 
he! Oh man. Good times. Politics. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
So. Down to brass tacks. Do you know 
this pit I'm talking about? 
MARK 
Yeah. Lot 48. I checked it out like a 
month ago. It's pretty gross. 
LESLIE 
As in a gross injustice! 
MARK 
Okay, but what I meant was, it's 
disgusting. 
People have been tossing their garbage 
into it. And I'm pretty sure there was a 
dead wolf in one corner. 
LESLIE 
Let me ask you this -- do you think I 
could turn it into a park? 
MARK 
A park. Huh. 
(beat) 
Well, when I think about the logistics, 
and the various hoops you'd have to jump 
through, I'd say: is it likely? No. But 
is it possible? No. It's not possible. 
You should give up. 
LESLIE 
What? Why? 
MARK 
There's a million reasons why. I used to 
try to get stuff like this off the ground 
when I started, but between the 
developers and the citizen groups, the 
bureaucrats and the anti-government 
nuts...it's impossible. 
LESLIE 
So there's a chance. 
MARK 
...No. There isn't. Aim smaller, is my 
advice. Have the wolf removed. You 
might be able to pull that off before 
Christmas. 
LESLIE 
Mark, I need your help on this. I need 
you to support it. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
Can you do me a favor? For old time's 
sake? 
LESLIE 
Mark and I...it's complicated. You work 
closely with someone, two strong 
personalities, passionate about the same 
things, sharing a worldview...things can 
happen. We slept together. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
A while ago. We didn't really talk about 
it much afterwards -- we're both 
professionals, and it doesn't affect our 
work. I don't know. Some day down the 
line, maybe we'll give it a chance to 
become something more. Who knows. 
MARK TALKING HEAD 
• MARK 
Leslie? No. 
(he thinks) 
Oh my God -- wait -- yes, we did! Wow, I 
totally forgot about that. Yes. She's 
right. Like five years ago. After some 
kind of...party or something? I was 
pretty drunk. Anyway. Yeah. How about 
that. 
MARK 
Why do you care about this pit? What's 
your angle here? 
LESLIE 
No "angle." I've been here six years, I 
know more about our city and the 
government than anyone else, and I've 
never had my own project. It's not fair! 
It's like, we're back in school and I've 
studied really hard and they're not 
letting me take the tests Imagine how 
• frustrating that would be. 

MARK 
God if those tests had been called off, I 
would have been pissed. And those lousy 
snow days too. I hated those. 
LESLIE 
I know! Mark, I believe that government 
can do good things, but you need power, 
and getting this park made would give me 
power. The more power I can get, the 
more good I can do. If I had absolute 
power, I could do absolute good! 
MARK 
Your enthusiasm is...intense, and off-
putting-- 
LESLIE 
Thank you. 
MARK 
But take it from me -- it's just not 
going to happen. 
LESLIE 
But I promised those people I would make 
this happen. I promised them in the 
meeting. 
MARK 
Well, you'll just have to accept that you 
will be the first bureaucrat in history 
to make a promise and fail to deliver on 
it. 
LESLIE  
Not me! 
Why do I always think of the perfect 
response like one second too late? 
ANN 
Can you just straighten up your area a 
little honey? They're going to be here 
soon. 
ANDY 
Sure. 
ANN 
(to camera) 
That parks lady is coming over, and we're 
going to see the pit. Probably just a 
photo op for her, I bet. I still think 
there's no way the government-- 
Shhh. 
ANDY 
ANN 
Excuse me? 
ANDY 
C'mon, honey, if I wanted to watch the 
news I'd be watching the news. 
ANN 
I'm talking about the pit you fell in. 
ANDY 
But it's boring. That's why we have TV, 
take our minds off boring stuff like 
that. 
ANN 
Yeah, boring stuff. Like fixing 
problems. Dealing. Improving things. 
ANDY 
Yeah. Either one. 
ANDY TALKING HEAD 
ANDY 
Here's the deal. 
ANDY (CONT'D) 
When Ann sees something broken, she feels 
obliged to fix it. I don't know why, and 
I don't really care. 
It's the only reason I've eaten a hot 
meal in the last three years. 
LESLIE 
Hello, Ann. 
ANN 
Hey. Wow. 
LESLIE 
This is Tom Haverford, my loyal co- 
worker. And this is Aubrey, our college 
intern. She's going to document our fact-
finding mission. 
ANN 
Okay -- let me just get my purse... 
 
LESLIE 
This must be our hero. "The man heard  
round the world." How you doing, son? 
ANDY 
...Hey. 
LESLIE 
On behalf of the government of Pawnee, I 
want to say that we're going to do 
everything we can to help you. Stay brave. 
ANDY 
Okay. 
(beat) 
Can you hand me that TV Guide? 
TOM 
So, you're a nurse. 
ANN 
Yeah. 
TOM 
Like, general nurse or some special kind? 
ANN 
General, but I get people ready for 
imaging tests a lot, so that's my 
specialty. 
TOM 
Do you have to shave a lot of wieners? 
ANN 
No. 
TOM 
Sometimes when I brush my teeth there's 
blood. 
ANN 
(sigh) 
Well are you using a soft bristle 
toothbrush? 
TOM 
Extra soft. Do I look like an idiot? 
ANN 
You should go to a doctor. You might 
have cancer of the tooth enamel. 
TOM 
Oh god. 
LESLIE 
Let's go! Fact-finding mission! 
ANN 
Right over there is where he fell in. 
LESLIE 
My God. How did we let this happen? 
Soil. Unstable. Crumbly. This whole 
lot could be vulnerable to mudslides. 
Aubrey -- get some pictures of this. 
AUBREY 
Of what? 
LESLIE 
Everything. This whole thing. 
ANN 
So, you think we can fill it in, plant 
some grass, maybe a bench or a tree? 
LESLIE 
Possibly. But dream with me for a 
second: why shouldn't this neighborhood 
have a first class park? With a 
playground, for kids. Do you have kids? 
TOM 
I'd say no. 
ANN 
...No. 
LESLIE 
Okay, but there are a lot of kids in the 
neighborhood, right? Kids that would 
love a shiny new playground, with swings 
and a softball field and a pool, and a 
jungle gym and tennis courts? And maybe 
over there: an amphitheater, for 
Shakespeare-in-the-Park. 
ANN  
It's not that big a pit. 
LESLIE 
Well, some of those things. Think about 
it! A little playground arises from the 
ashes of a deadly pit. We could name it 
after your boyfriend. "The Ann's 
Boyfriend Memorial Park." 
ANN 
LESLIE 
"The
Playground." It'll take a little extra 
work, but why not try? 
ANN 
I think that would be great. 
LESLIE 
Good. Me too.  
(beat) 
I'm going in. 
ANN 
Why? 
LESLIE 
• I need to see it for myself. Don't 
worry. I've got a hard hat on. 
ANN 
I see that. 
LESLIE 
Aubrey -- document this. 
The key to any fact-finding mission is 
you have to really get into the battle 
zone. Like a President surveying a 
hurricane-ravaged town. Or when Richard 
Nixon went to China, to see...you know, 
what the Chinese were up to. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
A politician can't be effective if she 
doesn't see the problem first-hand. You 
have to -- 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
(bleeped, obviously) 
Fuck! Ow! Shit! God Dammit! Fuck it! 

ANN 
Whoa! Leslie! 
LESLIE (0.C.) 
Faaaaaaaaa! 
ANN 
Oh my God. Are you okay? 
TOM 
Let's ditch her. It'll be hilarious. 
TOM 
Hey, that's a good one. Email me that 
please. 
AUBREY 
She's dustier in this one. 
TOM 
I'll take that one too. 
ANN 
• Does it hurt a lot? 
LESLIE 
No. 
ANN 
Right. 
LESLIE 
How can you tell? 
ANN 
I'm a nurse. 
LESLIE 
Thank goodness I was wearing the hard 
hat. 
ANN 
But it fell off. 
LESLIE  
After my head hit that rod. 
ANN 
• Well, you should be all set now. Hey, 
you shed blood for the cause. Now we're 
sisters. 

CONTINUED: 
LESLIE 
I've always wanted a sister. 
ANDY 
I can't believe you fell in too. That's 
hilarious. 
ANN 
It's not "hilarious," Andy. 
ANDY 
It's pretty hilarious. 
LESLIE 
Thanks... Sis. 
ANN 
No sweat. 
LESLIE 
Okay. I am going to show my boss, Ron 
Swanson, our findings, and demonstrate 
how dangerous this pit is. He'll have to 
listen to me, with a broken clavicle. 
ANN 
Nothing is broken. 
LESLIE 
Trust me, it's broken. Do you have one 
of those foam collar neck braces? 
ANN  
Seriously, you're fine. 
ANN (CONT'D) 
Hey -- this is really cool, that you're 
helping me with this. 

CONTINUED: 
LESLIE 
Yes. Well, I'm a public servant. You're the public. 
It's my honor and pleasure to serve you. 
Ann smiles. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
Why don't you come by my office later -- 
we can talk about the project, maybe grab 
some Starbucks, maybe gab a little. 
ANN 
Sure. Why not. 
ANN TALKING HEAD 
ANN 
I don't know. She's a little doofy, but 
she's sweet. 

LESLIE 
I may have misunderestimated Ann. She's 
• very dedicated to the cause, like I am. 
At first, I thought she was just 
a...well, I hate the word "bitch," it 
demeans women. I thought she was a bee-
yotch. But now -- I wouldn't say she's my 
best friend, but we're very good friends, 
and getting better all the time. 
And health care is a huge issue. A hot 
nurse can be a very powerful political 
symbol. 

RON 
Explain this again. 

LESLIE 
I want a committee, Ron. I want to explore 
• the possibility of putting a park on Lot 

RON 
Aw, that lot is zoned commercial. When 
the economy turns around, I'll have 
plenty of developers who would love to 
exploit that property. You were supposed 
to put this fire out. 
LESLIE 
Here's the thing, Ron. When you've been 
in the pit -- have you been in the pit? 
RON 
What? No. 
LESLIE 
Well, I have. 
RON 
When you fell in? 
LESLIE 
When I visited the bottom of the pit on a 
fact-finding mission. And when you're 
down in the pit... well, you really get 
perspective about what it all means.  
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
I've been a loyal soldier, Ron, but I 
want my shot. Give me lot 48. 
Let me form a sub-committee, and explore 
the possibility of building a small park. 
RON 
I'll definitely think about it. 
LESLIE 
I like the sound of that "definitely.". 

RON  
I don't want this Parks Department to 
build a park because I don't believe in 
government. 
I believe government is a waste of 
taxpayer money. My dream is to have the 
public park system privatized and run 
entirely for profit by corporations. 
McDonald's I think would be a good fit. 
Imagine a shiny clean McDonald's in every 
park. Corporations are so much cooler 
than government. 
RON (CONT'D) 
This office is a symbol of how I feel 
about government: 
This M-16 was given to me as a present by 
a prominent local gun dealer. I bought 
two and he threw in a third for free. 
• People who come in to ask me for things 
have to stare right down the barrel. 
RON SWANSON (CONT'D) 
What? The barrel's been concreted. I 
would have to pull out this plug for it 
to be fully operational. 
RON SWANSON (CONT'D) 
This is a partially defused Claymore 
mine. I want to remind people that 
asking me for anything is a minefield. 

RON SWANSON (CONT'D) 
That's my crown jewel. It's called a 
""Czech Hedgehog," and it was used to keep 
Allied tanks off the beaches in France. 
It cost me eleven thousand dollars to 
• ship it here. I had to have the floor 
reinforced. I like it. 
(beat) 
I think it's beautiful.

Hey, how's it going? Is Leslie around? 
AUBREY 
What is this regarding? 
ANN 
Aubrey, it's me. It's Ann, from the pit. 

MARK 
Lot 48, right? Sullivan Street? 
I'm Mark, I'm a city planner. 
ANN 
Ann Logan. Hi. 
MARK 
So I want to tell you I have a lot of 
respect for community activists. You 
guys get dumped on so much, but you keep 
at it, organizing the poor, and giving 
people a voice and really keeping us 
honest in the government. Really cool 
work. 
ANN 
I agree, but I'm not a community 
activist. I'm a nurse. 
MARK 
I feel exactly the same way about nurses. 

ANN 
Really? Exactly, the same way? How lucky 
for you that you didn't just make a 
really embarrassing mistake. 
MARK 
I know, right? Thank god. 

ANN 
Who else do you completely respect 
and admire in exactly the same way? 
Animal trainers? Rental car phone 
reservation takers? 
MARK 
Yup. All of them. 
MARK (CONT'D) 
So why is a nurse "taking on the 
system?" What's in this for you? 
ANN 
Oh. Well, between you and me, I own 
all the nearby lots. I'm thinking 
if I can get the city to commit to 
fixing this, I can get it for a low 
price, bundle it with my lots, and 
put up a new mall. 
MARK 
Wow. 
Okay. 
ANN 
I'm kidding. There's a hole in the 
ground, it's ugly and people are 
falling into it. That's all. 

MARK 
I knew Leslie fell in. Tom emailed 
me a picture this morning. But who 
else? 
ANN 
...My boyfriend. 
MARK 
He 
okay? 
ANN 
Yeah, he's fine. He's great. 
MARK 
What's he do for a living? 
ANN 
Why do you want to know? 

MARK  
Just making conversation. 
ANN 
He's a...musician. Potentially. I mean, 
yeah -- whatever -- he's a musician.  
LESLIE 
There she is! 
And there he is! There both of them are! 
ANN 
Hey Leslie! 
LESLIE 
I take it you've met. 
ANN 
We have. How are you feeling? 
LESLIE 
I'm feeling...optimistic. Waiting for 
news from "on high" about whether we get 
our committee. 
ANN 
Hey -- no matter what happens, I want to 
say thanks. I mean it. This is...way 
better than I thought it would be. You're 
really fighting for me. 
LESLIE 
Well. That's my job. You want a quick 
tour? 
ANN 
Sure...I have to leave in half an hour 


RON 
Are we meeting about something? 
MARK 
I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie and 
let her try to build a park. 
RON 
Why? 
MARK 
Doesn't matter. People like parks. 
RON 
It's a development lot. Restaurant, 
office building, something. 
• MARK 
You owe me one. Remember? In fact you 
owe me several. 
RON 
You want to cash in for this? 
MARK 
Yup. 
RON 
What's your angle? 
MARK 
Doesn't matter. 
RON 
Trading four years worth of favors for a 
park that'll never get built. You've 
gone soft. 
MARK 
And tell her in the next 30 minutes. 

LESLIE 
There are 85,000 people in Pawnee, and 
this building contains the entire 
government. "The Power Center." 
ANN  
This hallway is endless. 
LESLIE 
I know. We call it "Archway Alley." Or 
sometimes just: "The Hall." 
ANN 
Clever. 
LESLIE 
The building is called Pioneer Hall, 
named by the first inhabitants of this 
building in 1891. 
ANN 
Wow. 
LESLE (V.0.) 
Yes -- our crown jewel. These murals 
depict the battle of Conega Creek. 
LESLIE 
We put the minimum wage poster over the 
most horrible parts. 
ANN 
That's...horrifying. 
LESLIE 
Yes. Come on -- I'll show you the DMV 
offices! 
ANN 
Awesome. 
TOM 
Hey! Leslie! We did it! 
LESLIE (V.0.) 
Yes, Ron Swanson has approved our request 
• for a committee!  
LESLIE 
So exciting. This is my first committee, 
that I'll have headed by myself. Or with 
someone. First committee, ever, of any 
kind, for me. But...wow. I mean, in 
terms of my future? This is huge. I'm 
barely 34, and I've already landed a 
Parks Department exploratory sub-
committee! 
(jazzed) 
I'm a rocketship. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
To our beautiful new committee, a 
committee of dreams! And to America! 
TOM 
Here let me. 

TOM 
Leslie gets hammered a couple times a 
month. It's the only way I can tolerate 
her. 
MARK 
Hey -- just heard the news. 
Congratulations. 
LESLIE 
Thank you. It's very exciting. Do you 
think I should call a press conference 
right away? Try to get my picture out 
there? Or no -- I should wait. Don't 
want to overplay my hand. Okay. Good. 
So. Stay! Have a glass of champagne! 
MARK 
Why not. 
MARK (CONT'D) 
Hey. 
What's the story? 
TOM 
Don't bother. She's ice cold. I already 
took a run at her and got nowhere. 
MARK 
Well, maybe you'll do better tonight, 
with your wife. 
TOM 
Dude, why you gotta be like that? 
Leslie sidles up to Mark, fueled by liquid courage. 
LESLIE 
Well well well. Looks like you and I are 
going to be working together. 

MARK 
Looks like it. 
LESLIE 
Looks like it indood. Deed. Doo-dee-doo-
dee-doo. 
ANN 
Cheers! 
LESLIE 
Ann, I promise you -- I am going to work 
my butt off to get this project done. No 
matter how long it takes. This butt is 
coming off! 
Ann smiles. 
• MARK 
That's our Leslie. She's one tough bird. 
LESLIE 
America is a funny place. It's full of 
opportunities, full of hope, full of 
small towns and big cities and real 
people and delicious beverages and hot 
guys. You just'never know, in America, 
when opportunity is going to strike. 
Are you excited? 
ANN 
Definitely. I'm fired up. 
LESLIE 
• Yeah! 
ANN 
I've always heard that democracy, or 
whatever, only works if people get 
involved. Well, I'm getting involved! 
LESLIE 
That's right. 
"Soul sistah, soul sistah, soul sistah!" 
ANN 
I'm a nurse, you know? People come into 
the E.R. with chopped off fingers and 
compound fractures-- 
LESLIE 
Like me, with my clavicle! 
ANN 
-- sure -- and if I can handle real blood 
and guts, I can handle this. I'm making 
a vow here. No matter what, I'm going to 
get that pit filled in, even if it takes 
two months! 
What? What's so funny? 
LESLIE 
Wh0000000000! 

LESLIE 
At first the committee will just be the 
three of us and Mark. We'll have our 
meetings on Ann's days off. Now -- what 
to call the committee? 
TOM 
The Sub-Committee for a Better Tomorrow. 
LESLIE 
Too vague. That could be about anything. 
TOM 
The Sub-Committee for Improving Our 
Nation's...Tomorrows. 
• LESLIE 
Better... 
ANN 
Why can't it just be, like, "The 
Committee to Fill In the Pit?" 
LESLIE 
The name is crucial. It has to inspire 
confidence in taxpayers. "The Tennessee 
Valley Authority." Man, don't you just 
want to give your money to that? Aren't 
you happy that exists? 
How about "The Extraordinary Sub- 
Committee on Pit Enhancement?" 
ANN 
That sounds like we're making it bigger. 
LESLIE 
Pit Fixing? Fixation? Pit Betterment. 
TOM 
Pit Beautification? 
LESLIE 
• Pit Beautification. 
"Hi, Leslie Knope, Executive Director of 
the Departmental Ad-Hoc Sub-Committee for 
Pit Beautification." Boy, that sounds 
good.
