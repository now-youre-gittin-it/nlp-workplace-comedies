@ COLD OPEN
1 INT. PADDY'S IRISH PUB - LATE NIGHT - N/1 1
Mac and Charlie sit around the bar, smoking, drinking beer.
Dennis goes over receipts. Spirits are low.
DENNIS
Another big night, fellas. One
Hundred eighty four dollars and
sixty-seven cents.
MAC
Jesus Christ.
CHARLIE
On a Thursday night?
DENNIS
And our mortgage is due in two
weeks.
MAC
Didn't we just pay that goddamn
thing like a week ago?
DENNIS
Yes, Mac. And a week ago we were
three weeks late.
CHARLIE
What are we gonna do?
DENNIS
I don't know, Charlie. But, then
again, I don't know why I got into
business with you boners in the
first place, so I'm probably not
the right person to ask.
MAC
Dennis, take it easy.
DENNIS
Take it easy? If we don't start
making some money, we're gonna lose
the bar.
CHARLIE
We are not gonna lose the bar.
MAC
Let's not get hysterical, please.

Sweet Dee rushes in.
SWEET DEE
(quickly)
Alright, listen. I met new this guy
in my acting class. He's perfect
for me and he wants to see where I
work, so I told him we'd stop in.
He's parking the car now, could you
guys please, be cool for me?
MAC
Sweet Dee, of course we'll be cool.
SWEET DEE
I'm really into this guy, okay? So,
please be nice.
DENNIS
When are we not nice, sis? I think--
Just then, the door opens and in walks: TERRELL, a large
black dude.
© DENNIS
Oh hey man, we're closed.
TERRELL
Yeah, I know.
He closes the door. Mac jumps up. Charlie does the same.
MAC
Whoa, we're not looking for any
trouble, man.
TERRELL
What?
SWEET DEE
Guys. This is Terrell. From my
acting class.
Looocoocoocecong silence. Awkward.
CHARLIE
Oh.
DENNIS
Oh, okay. Right.
© TERRELL
How you doin'?

IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 3.
MAC
Good. Good, man.
Silence.
TERRELL
Guess you guys don't have a lot of
brothers walking in here, huh?
DENNIS
No man!
MAC
That's not it!
DENNIS
That's not it at all!
CHARLIE
We have plenty of brothers...black
people...
DENNIS
African American. African American
people coming in all the time.
© mac
You might know some of them...
TERRELL
Yeah, we're probably related.
MAC
No, that's not what I meant. I
wasn't implying that you're all
related.
DENNIS
He wasn't implying-
MAC
It was just that Sweet Dee said
that, uh...
CHARLIE
We weren't expecting Dee to...
MAC
We just didn't expect you to be
black.
Small beat.

IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 4.

FADE IN:
2 INT. PADDY'S - LATER - N/1 2
Some time has passed. Mac carries a couple of beers from the
bar. Terrell is in the middle of an intense diatribe.
TERRELL
-.ewnen I'm promoting you better
believe it's gonna be everybody and
their momma trying to get in. White
boys, brothas, Latinos, whatever.
We got niggas hanging from the
rafters!
CHARLIE
Absolutely.
TERRELL
So we got like four hundred plus
packed into this place.
DENNIS
© Four hundred?!
TERRELL
No joke. And it's mostly college
kids. My sista goes to Temple and
she's got the hookups there.
MAC
Hookups are good. Point of
clarification. When you say
"sista", you mean...
TERRELL
I mean my sister.
MAC
Great. It's just that sometimes it
could mean your friend, or you know-
CHARLIE
Mac, shut up.
TERRELL
SO we all packed into this tiny
little place on Walnut. We like
half way through the night,
everything's goin' fine when all of
a sudden, I see this dude eye
ballin me from across the bar.

IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 6.
TERRELL (CONT'D)
And I'm like, you know, I don't
know if this dude wants to freak me
or fight me, you know what I'm
sayin'?
Quick cut to Dennis. This sounds a little off.
MAC
Totally!
CHARLIE
This dude's givin' you crazy eyes!
TERRELL
So, I walk over to the dude. He's
this big, cut, Mexican mofo. And
I'm like Yo' esse, unless you
wanna get yo' ass torn apart yo
betta get that look off yo' face.
MAC
You just walked right up to him and
said that?
TERRELL
I had to make the first move, son.
@ Always make the first move!
We find Dennis, once again, struggling through the innuendo.
MAC
Badass.
SWEET DEE
So what happened?
TERRELL
This dude, just kept staring me
down. So we like eye ball to eye
ball. I'm three inches from this
dude's grill. It feels like
eternity, son! Then he finally
opens his mouth...and says: "I
guess you gonna have to tear my ass
apart then, holmes."
Rapt silence.
MAC
Oh shit.
SWEET DEE
Oh my God. What did you do?

8
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 7.
TERRELL
I had no choice... I took him to
the back alley... and I tore his
ass apart.
Everyone explodes into applause! Dennis is trying to figure
out exactly what Terrell is talking about. "Tore his ass
apart?"
SWEET DEE
Wow.
MAC
You are the man!
As the gang carries on, Dennis notices, just for a brief
second that Terrell is staring at him. Terrell gives a little
suggestive nod. We stay with Dennis for a long moment.
MAC (0.S.)
I love that guy!
3 EXT. JAVA HUT - NEXT DAY - D/2 3
Mac, Dennis, and Charlie walk up to a table outside the
coffee shop and have a seat.
MAC
"I took him to the back alley
Who does shit like that? It's like
a movie!
DENNIS
I don't know. There was something
about him that was a little off.
MAC
Uh...racist.
DENNIS
No asshole. That's not what I
meant.
CHARLIE
I'il get the coffee. What do you
guys want?
DENNIS
Dude, just wait until the waitress
comes out here. You can stare at
her then.

IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELFHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 8.
CHARLIE
I wasn't going to stare at her.
DENNIS
Sure you weren't. It's pathetic,
Charlie, you're totally obsessed
with that chick.
CHARLIE
I am not.
DENNIS
It's never gonna happen, dude.
MAC
Hey, we should totally hire
Terrell!
DENNIS
I don't know.
MAC
Dude, you heard him. When he's
promotin', everybody and they
mommas are lookin' to get in.
The Waitress approaches from behind Charlie.
CHARLIE
Yeah. They have niggers hanging
from rafters.
WAITRESS
Wow. Nice.
CHARLIE
No, I was quoting-
She walks off to another table with coffees.
CHARLIE
I was quoting a black...great, now
she thinks I'm racist.
DENNIS
I thought you said you weren't into
her.
CHARLIE
I'm not. It's just...that, I don't
want her thinking that.

IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 9.
MAC
Den, let's give Terrell a shot. If
he delivers half of what he
promises, we're looking at like two
hundred people.
DENNIS
It would be nice to actually get
some chicks into Paddy's. Alright,
let's give him a shot.

5 EXT. NORTH PHILADELPHIA - DAY - D/2 5
Mac and Charlie walk along the sidewalk near the University.
CHARLIE
You sure about this?
MAC
It's two thousand five, Charlie.
Don't you think it's a damn shame
that you have no friends outside of
© your own race.
CHARLIE
So what are you planning to do?
MAC
We're gonna go in there and try to
diversify. Make friends with people
of other cultures, you know,
broaden our horizons.
CHARLIE
You just wanna impress Terrell with
new black friends.
MAC stares at him. Then:
MAC
Charlie. Don't be a dick.
6 INT. STUDENT UNION MOMENTS LATER - D/2 6
Mac and Charlie walk into a large common area packed with
black students hanging out, talking, and playing "Bones". A
particularly heated game is being played.

11
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 10.
DAMON
I'm a bust that shit up, Reese. I'm
a bust that shit up!
Damon slams down his move. Mac sidles up to the table. All
eyes on him. Why is he just standing there in silence?
MAC
Eventually, the attention is taken off Mac, and the game
resumes.
MAC
(whispering)
Sort of a hostile environment.
Maybe we need to rethink this.
A beautiful senior, KAREN, walks over. She addresses Charlie.
KAREN
Hey. What's your name?
CHARLIE
Charlie.
@ KAREN
Do you play bones, Charlie?
CHARLIE
I dabble.
KAREN
Do you wanna play? I could get you
a game.
CHARLIE
I really shouldn't. I'm not very
good.
KAREN
Oh, that doesn't matter.
CHARLIE
It's been a long time.
KAREN
Oh, come on.
CHARLIE
Well, maybe just one game.

CHARLIE
Domino, bitch!
The crowd erupts. Charlie is now flanked by black students.
They love this kid. Mac is off to the side, being ignored.
8 INT. STUDENT UNION - LATER - D/2 8
Mac and Charlie walk around the Student Union.
MAC
This is bullshit, dude. Absolute
bullshit. Why do those people like
you more than they like me?
CHARLIE
Maybe it's comments like that.
MAC
I meant those people in there. In
that room. Not all black people.
What am I supposed to say in that
situation?
© Another beautiful black girl, JANELLE, approaches Charlie.
JANELLE
Hey. I'm Janelle.
CHARLIE
Hey.
JANELLE
You got nice moves, Charlie.
She smiles seductively at him.
CHARLIE
Oh. Thanks.
Janelle slips him a piece of paper.
JANELLE
I wanted to give you this. Give me
a call sometime.
CHARLIE
Yeah, okay, sure.
She walks off. Charlie crumbles up the paper and throws it on
@ the ground,

13
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 12.
MAC
What are you doing, dude?
CHARLIE
What?
MAC
How could you blow that chick off?
That chick is gorgeous and it's
like the perfect opportunity to
prove we are not racist.
Mac picks up the crumpled paper.
CHARLIE
Well, I think, if anything, we
should be focused on black men.
MAC
What the hell are you talking
about? You've gotta call this girl.
CHARLIE
She's not really what we need. We
need black guys.
wa
Guys? Why does it have to be guys?
Mac studies Charlie for a beat.
MAC (CONT'D)
Is this about that waitress?
CHARLIE
What? No.
MAC
It's never gonna happen, dude.
You've gotta stop with this shit.
CHARLIE
I don't care about that.
MAC
Let me see your wallet.
CHARLIE
Why?
MAC
Do you still have a picture of her
© in your wallet?

14
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 13.
CHARLIE
No, dude,
MAC
Let me see it.
They stare each other down for a beat. They wrestle awkwardly
for a little while before Mac grabs Charlie's wallet from his
back pocket. Charlie lunges for it.
CHARLIE
Dude, don't! Give me it!
Mac pulls out a picture of the waitress, showing it to
Charlie. They are breathless.
MAC
(threatening to rip it)
Eh? Eh?
CHARLIE
No don't. Okay, fine. call the
black girl. I'll call her.

11 INT. PADDY'S - NIGHT - N/2 11
Sweet Dee is behind the bar. Dennis drinks a beer. Charlie
and Mac play pool. The place is empty.
SWEET DEE
I had the strangest dream last
night. I was in Cleveland, Ohio,
which is really funny cause I've
never been to Ohio.
DENNIS
I don't want to hear about your
dreams, Dee. I hate listening to
people's dreams. It's like flipping
through a stack of photographs I'm
not in. I don't care.
The door opens and in walks Terrell.
TERRELL
Yo, wassup?
Sweet Dee instantly sweetens.

15
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 14.
SWEET DEE
Hey!
Terrell walks to her and she attempts a lips-on-lips closed
mouth kiss. He averts it, presenting his cheek. Awkward.
DENNIS
Hey, Terrell, how you doing?
TERRELL
Come here. I wanna show you
somethin'.
Dennis gets up and walks to the door. Terrell opens it.
12 EXT. PADDY'S - CONTINUOUS - N/2 12
The guys look out the door. There's a line of
all people reaching
the way around the corner.
TERRELL
Rule number one. Always keep a
line.
Dennis smiles. He turns to Terrell who is, once again,
staring at his genitals suggestively.
13 INT. PADDY'S - LATER - N/2 13
The bar is now PACKED; shoulder to shoulder. Music is blaring
out of the jukebox and people are drinking heavily.
13a AT THE BAR - N/2 13A
Sweet Dee can barely keep up with the orders. Dennis is
behind the bar helping her out.
DENNIS
This is crazy!
SWEET DEE
I told you! Terrell is the best!
DENNIS
I'm gonna have to start bartending
full time! Look at this!
He points to a large bowl filled with cash tips. Sweet Dee
looks over at her bowl. It has a quarter of what Dennis has.
SWEET DEE
Why are you getting more tips than
me?

16
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 15,

Mac fights his way to the bar.
MAC
Jesus! This is crazy!
DENNIS
He really packed them in, huh?
MAC
Yeah.
Charlie comes up to the bar carrying empties.
CHARLIE
This is crazy!
DENNIS
I know! We were just saying that!
CHARLIE
No fights? Nothing?
DENNIS
Not a thing! It's a nice crowd.
Well behaved.
They 'scan the room. The place is filled with good looking,
well dressed young men. Beat:
CHARLIE
Lotta dudes.
DENNIS
Yeah. Lotta dudes.
MAC
Ton of dudes.
A group of really handsome men is trying to get their
attention.
HANDSOME GUY
Excuse me, bartender?
They whisper and giggle to one another. Sweet Dee walks to
them. She's deals with this all the time.
SWEET DEE
What can I get you boys?

17
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 16

We'd actually like to wait for the
other one.

What other one?
Handsome guy motions to Dennis, who doesn't notice.
Charlie notices BRETT MAC, 27, coming in the front door.

Mac smiles.

together yourself?
MAC
No we had a promoter.
BRETT
I just had to see it for myself.
CHARLIE
What do you mean?
Beat.
BRETT

The current jukebox song abruptly ends and there's a short
moment of silence. We look wide at the packed bar.

TERRELL
I'm a musical theater actor living
in Philadelphia. I didn't think it
was a big secret.
SWEET DEE
But, I've been coming on to you for
weeks !
TERRELL
I just thought you were into gay
dudes.
SWEET DEE
I am not into gay dudes.
TERRELL
Apparently you are.

We made more money in one night
than in the entire year we've owned
this place.
CHARLIE
This is the greatest thing that's
ever happened to us! I think we
should totally embrace the
situation.

He picks up a newspaper and reads.
MAC
"Looking for that new hot spot to

Pub has plugged that hole."
CHARLIE
That's a nice notice.
MAC
No it's not! I don't want to he
plugging any holes.

22
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 21.
SWEET DEE
I agree with Mac on this one.
DENNIS
Of course you do. I made three
hundred dollars in tips last night.
How much did you make?
SWEET DEE
That's not the point!
DENNIS
Sure it isn't, Dee.
CHARLIE
I don't think we have much of a
choice.
MAC
If you assholes recall, one of the
reasons we bought that shit hole in
the first place was to get laid!
CHARLIE
Maybe all you wanted was to get
©
laid, but I, my friend, have a
little something called business
ethics.
MAC
Shut up, Charlie. The only reason
you don't care is because you have
black girls hanging all over you.
But you know what, dude? You're
gonna screw it up.
CHARLIE
Screw it up? I'm sorry, my friend,
but I actually have a date with one
of them today.
DENNIS
Look, Mac, It's a purely fiscal
decision,
SWEET DEE
That's bullshit, Dennis. This has
nothing to do with money. You just
like all the attention.
DENNIS
What's that supposed to mean?

WAITRESS
What do you want, Charlie?
CHARLIE
I'd like you to take a look at the
beautiful African American girl
sitting at that table there.
WAITRESS
Okay?
CHARLIE
@ That woman is my friend.
WAITRESS
Good for you.
CHARLIE
So, you see, the other day, when
you heard me saying something about
"people" hanging from rafters-
WAITRESS
What do you want?
Charlie thinks for a beat.
CHARLIE
Maybe now that you know I am not
racist, maybe we could-
WAITRESS
Dude. N.O. How many times am I
going to have to say it?
Janelle approaches.
JANELLE
What's going on over here?

26
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 25.
WAITRESS
Charlie's using you to prove he's

date.
JANELLE
Charlie? Is this true?
CHARLIE
Well-
Before Charlie can finish the sentence, Janelle punches him
in the face.
20 INT. PADDY'S - NIGHT N/3 20
Paddy's is once again in full gay swing. Charlie sits at the
bar. Sweet Dee is holding a bag of ice over the giant KNOT
across his left eye. Mac stands next to them.
SWEET DEE
I think you should see a doctor,
Charlie. This looks bad.
CHARLIE
I already went. He told me Janelle
almost cracked my skull.
SWEET DEE
Just make sure you keep this thing-
wait, what did you say this girl's
name is?
CHARLIE
Janelle. Jenkins. She told me if
she ever saw me again she'd slit my
throat. I believe her.
SWEET DEE
And you met her at Temple?
CHARLIE
Yeah.
Sweet Dee realizes something. Mac taps her.
MAC
Are you two seeing this?
Dennis, wearing a tank top, is behind.the bar dancing and
singing along to Madonna. He's making drinks. He looks over
and smiles.

And this Mary over here is the
belle of the ball. Why do these
people like you guys so much?
CHARLIE
It's not that they like us, Mac.
It's that they don't like you.
Nobody likes you. Because you're an
asshole.
Charlie walks off.
MAC
Is that true?
© SWEET DEE
Yeah, kinda. Listen, we need to
talk.

21 INT. BACK OFFICE ~ MOMENTS LATER - N/3 21
Sweet Dee and Mac enter the back office.
SWEET DEE
This girl that Charlie's talking
about from Temple, Janelle Jenkins?
I know her.
MAC
So what?
Sweet Dee smiles.
SWEET DEE
I think I know how to make things
normal around here. Okay, first off
we need to deal with Dennis. I want
you to get him wasted tonight.
Blackout wasted. You feed him
enough tequila to kill a horse. Can
you do that?
MAC
No problen.
Sweet Dee heads for the door.
MAC
Where are you going?
SWEET DEE
I need to talk to a couple of
friends from my acting class. Then
I'm going up to Temple. Just make
sure Dennis gets hammered. Black
out hammered.

21AA INT. PADDY'S IRISH PUB ~ LATER - N/3 21AA
Mac is holding a shot of tequila next to an already
intoxicated, groggy Dennis.
MAC
I'm pretty sure the lime goes
first.
DENNIS
No, dude, the salt's first.
MAC
Nope. It's the lime.
Dennis grabs the shot.
DENNIS
Watch.
He licks his hand, downs, the shot and sucks the lime.
DENNIS
There. You see?
MAC
So you do the shot first? Wait a
second, do it again.
Dennis sighs and grabs the bottle of tequila.
DENNIS
You're pathetic, dude.

Dennis does one of those drunk sighs as if he's holding back
vomit. Mac smiles.
21A INT. UNKNOWN BEDROOM ~ NEXT MORNING - D/4 21A
An alarm clock BLARES. 6:00 AM Dennis peels his head off the
pillow and swats at the clock with his hand. He grabs his
pounding head.
DENNIS
Oh my God.
He looks around.
DENNIS (CONT'D)
Where the hell am I?
He notices the bare back of a naked body lying next to him.
The back is slender with a mop of blond hair.
DENNIS (CONT'D)
Hey now?
Dennis pulls the sheets a little lower to sneak a peak at the
naked ass.
DENNIS (CONT'D)
Nice.
Then he looks under the sheets to see if he is also naked.
DENNIS (CONT'D)
Very nice.
The body rolls over and we meet: A YOUNG BOY/MAN with long
blond hair and a thin blond mustache.
BOY
Hey lover.
Dennis shoots out of bed. Covering his genitals with a
pillow.
DENNIS
Whoa! No! No! This is not...I
don't....what happened here?
BOY
What do you mean?
DENNIS
What's going on!? What happened
here?

31
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 29-33.
BOY
Relax stud. You got nothing to be
ashamed about.
DENNIS
What the hell are you...did
we...did we have...
BOY
No silly.
DENNIS
Oh my God. Thank God.
BOY
It was all hands.
A large man in a towel walks in the room behind Dennis.
LARGE MAN IN TOWEL
Hey! My boys are up!
He smacks Dennis on his bare ass.
LARGE MAN IN TOWEL (CONT'D)
How's that ass feeling?

23 EXT. PADDY'S - LATER - D/4 23
CHARLIE (0.S.}
I'm really glad you decided to
embrace this, Mac.
23A INT. PADDY'S - SAME TIME - D/4 23A
Charlie and Mac play darts.
MAC
Yeah, me too.
CHARLIE
I really just think this is a great
business decision.
MAC
Yeah. I guess I just decided that
you guys were right. I think owning
a gay bar is a great idea.
Dennis comes storming in.

32
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 34.
DENNIS
I don't wanna own a gay bar
anymore.
CHARLIE
What?!
MAC
Oh no. What happened?
DENNIS
I've just been doing some thinking
and I feel like we had our little
experiment but it's time to go back
to normal.
MAC
You're done experimenting? All done
with the experiments?
DENNIS
With the bar. The experiment with
the bar.
CHARLIE
But Terrell's helping us
redecorate. He's really pumped.
Terrell walks in from the back.
TERRELL
Hey, Dennis. I brought some new
music for the jukebox. The stuff
you guys have in there's a little
dated. Now, I think the first thing
we do is get rid of all these
shamrocks.
DENNIS
Terrell we have to talk.
Mac steps to the back of the bar and takes out his cell
phone.
24 INT. SWEET DEE'S CAR - SAME TIME D/4 24
Sweet Dee answers her phone.
MAC (0.8.)
Everybody's here.
© SWEET DEE
Alright, we're right outside.

25 INT. PADDY'S - D/4 25
Mac returns to the group.
TERRELL
I don't understand. I thought you
guys were happy.
MAC
Dennis had his experiment and
changed his mind.
DENNIS
With the bar, dude! Stop saying it
like that.
TERRELL
I think you guys are being
ridiculous.
CHARLIE
Me too! I thought we were trying to
be open minded! I thought we wanted
to expand our horizons!
SWEET DEE
Hey, everybody!
MAC
Hey, Dee! Look, everybody! Sweet
Dee's here!
Everyone turns to see: Sweet Dee standing with Janelle.
JANELLE
Charlie?
CHARLIE
Oh shit!
Charlie jumps backwards in instinctual self preservation.
JANELLE
What the hell are you doing here?
CHARLIE
Look, okay, I said I was sorry! You
smashed my face, what else do you
want?!
TERRELL
Janelle?

34
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 36.
JANELLE
Terrell? What the hell you hangin'
out with this dickhead for?
DENNIS
What's going on?
MAC
Do you two know each other?
CHARLIE
This is the bitch that cracked my
skull!
TERRELL
Charlie. This is Janelle.
(beat)
My sister.
Looooocooong beat. Mac smiles.
CHARLIE
Your sister?
TERRELL
© Yeah.
Beat. Awkward. Mac is loving this. He obnoxiously interjects.
MAC
Point of clarification. Your
"sista"?
TERRELL
My sister.
MAC
Right!
There's yet another tense moment of silence.
MAC
(smiling)
So you're actually related?
TERRELL
Yeah.

35
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA - EP 101 - "THE GANG GETS RACIST" GREEN **FULLY COLLATED** 5/31/05 37.
MAC
Ha! Earlier you were implying that
I was racist because you thought
that I was implying that all black
people are related and then it
turns out that you people actually
are.
Charlie and Dennis hang their heads. Mac thinks about what he
just said. Then:
MAC
I mean you people. You two. Not all
black people.
SWEET DEE
Mac, shut up.
We go wide taking it all in. Five people standing in silence.
TERRELL
I quit.
BLACK.

© that get him so freaked out?
SWEET DEE
Oh, I forgot to tell you - that
didn't work out.
MAC
What?
SWEET DEE
Yeah, I couldn't get a hold of
them.
MAC
So why was he so freaked out?
SWEET DEE
I don't know...
They consider this for a moment as we:
FADE OUT.
