SILICON VALLEY

FADE IN:
CREDIT SEQUENCE:
WE SEE SHOT AFTER SHOT of what passes for exciting in the 
Valley - Billboards about things we don’t understand, packs 
of geeks, Logo T-shirts.  Road signs that read CUPERTINO, 
MENLO PARK, PALO ALTO.  The shit brown colored hills of 
Mountainview and past the entrances to Facebook, Google, 
CISCO, etc.  We also see quick scenes of people pitching at 
accelerators, and the video of Steve Balmer ranting onstage.  
Larry Ellison. Elon Musk with a Rocket.  Steve Wozniak trying 
to groove on his Segway.  All mixed together in a high energy 
montage. 
EXT. EAST PALO ALTO - HACKER HOUSE
WE PAN THROUGH a nondescript neighborhood and end on a not- 
well-maintained house with a scrubby yard.  This could easily 
be the homestead of upwardly mobile white trash or downwardly 
mobile professionals.
INT. HACKER HOUSE - DAY
We pan through the denizens of Hacker House: An East Indian 
guy, DINESH, who always wears a rugby shirt and is now 
punching away furiously on his laptop; CALVIN, a black guy 
with braces and glasses who looks like a younger version of 
Eddie Murphy in Bowfinger; a fat white guy with a pony tail 
and a black shirt and black sweat pants, ROLAND, who seems to 
be drawing a Celtic tattoo on his arm with an ink pen; oddest 
of all is a skinny Asian fellow, JIN YANG, who is working 
away at a stand up work station. No matter what they are 
doing they also are plugged into something else and are 
eating instant Ramen.  We end on our hero, THOMAS.  He is 
incredibly focused as he rapidly types code on a computer 
screen.  His best friend, BIG HEAD (who does have an 
unusually large noggin), comes up.  Big Head is holding a 
Perplexus (the small ball-shaped game these guys are all 
obsessed with).
BIG HEAD
Hey, man, some guys from Zynga are 
throwing an all-night Perplexus
tourney.  Maybe we can find some 
Stanford kids to hustle.
Big Head twists and turns the ball, finishing it in a 
ridiculously fast amount of time.  Thomas never breaks his 
concentration.

2.
THOMAS
Can’t.
Big Head takes a closer look at the screen. 
BIG HEAD
Goddamn, Thomas, that’s a buttload
of code.  
This gets the attention of Jin Yang at the stand-up work 
station.  Tall and skinny, he has a thick Taiwanese accent 
and pretty much every other word is shit, fuck, motherfucker, 
and dude.
JIAN YANG
Sheee-it, mother fucker you can 
like buy compression software.  You 
don’t have to fucking write that 
shit.  You can buy that shit!
BIG HEAD
Or download a bootleg.
THOMAS
None of that CodeAcademy crap for 
my web site.   The whole idea of 
Pied Piper is based on melody 
recognition.  If it doesn’t work 
perfectly, no one will want in. So, 
I am making it perfect.  
Thomas turns and calls off.
THOMAS (CONT’D)
Hey, Dinesh, can you test this 
module for me?
DINESH
Can I eat your salmon?
THOMAS
(grudging)
OK.
Dinesh takes Thomas’s lunch and sits down at the computer and 
starts running tests.
Big Head looks a little hurt.
BIG HEAD
You’re letting him test your 
module?
Thomas tries to put a positive spin on things.

THOMAS
You’ve got the Perplexus tourney.  
I want you to fuck those guys up.
This fires up Big Head.  He uses some very awkward body 
English to put a flourish on his Perplexus move.  
The House Nerd, ERLICH walks in and sees this.
ERLICH
And you wonder why there are never 
any girls around here. 
We see that Erlich is wearing his favorite “I Know HTML -- 
How To Meet Ladies” shirt.  
ERLICH (CONT’D)
Hey Thomas, can we talk for a 
second?
THOMAS
OK.
Erlich doesn’t make much eye contact but is still somehow 
very aggressive.
ERLICH
Thomas, I’m gonna have to ask you 
to vacate.
THOMAS
What?  Why?
ERLICH
You’ve been here six months.  I 
gave you place a to live and plug 
in.  You’ve given me nothing. 
THOMAS
Look, Pied Piper is going to take 
off. The website is up and running, 
it works great, it just needs--
Erlich cuts him off.
ERLICH
Pied Piper is crap.  When you 
pitched it you said, “The Google of 
Music.” I thought it had 
“Applications”.
THOMAS
It does! Have you been on it since 
I revamped it?

THOMAS (CONT'D)
Once it takes off Pied Piper will 
be able to search the whole world 
of recorded music to see if there 
is a match.  If you’re a song 
writer... or a band... or anything, 
and you wanted to make sure you 
weren’t infringing on copy righted 
material, you could find out in no 
time.  
Erlich just gives his head a curt shake.
ERLICH
First of all, nobody cares about 
stealing other people’s music.  
Jesus, they do it on purpose!  Jay-
Z and Puffy made whole careers on 
it.
THOMAS
They didn’t steal it, they had to 
get permission from the copyright 
owners...
ERLICH
They don’t own dick.  There’s no 
money in music anymore.  Everyone 
involved in music is either 
stealing it or sharing it.  They’re 
all assholes. And they’re all suing 
each other. To stay here, you have 
to deliver.  Or at least show some 
promise for fuck’s sake.
Erlich motions to Big Head.
ERLICH (CONT’D)
Like NipAlert.  Big Head’s app.   
It gives you the location of a 
woman with erect nipples. That’s 
something people want. How’s that 
coming along?
Big Head gives him two thumbs up.
BIG HEAD
Almost ready to enter Beta Phase.
Thomas turns back to Erlich.  He is desperate and fishing.
THOMAS
Look, I want to change the world.  
Make it a better place...

6
5.
Erlich knows he has to pay lip service to this trope.
ERLICH
We all want to change the world and 
make it better.  Like I did when I 
developed Accutran.  A lot of 
companies use a lot of different 
software to aggregate social media 
feedback -- Frontier Airlines just 
happened to like mine. 
Thomas digs in.
THOMAS
You can’t just kick me out.  When I 
signed up I was promised a month’s 
notice if I had to leave.  It’s in 
writing.
Erlich looks pissed.
ERLICH
Then I am giving you notice.  I 
hope you’re happy.  You know, when 
I sold Accutran there were a lot of 
things I could do with my money.  
But I wanted to give back.  I 
started this place to do something 
big.  Really make a difference.  
Like Steve.  
THOMAS
Jobs or Wozniak?
ERLICH
(duh)
Jobs.  Now, suppose Steve came back 
to us all reincarnated, because he 
was a Buddhist you know, and he 
showed up here at The Hacker Hostel 
looking for a place to help him get 
on his feet so he could launch the 
next big tech revolution.  What 
could I do? There’s no room for 
STEVE. Can you believe this?  I 
have to tell Steve to fuck off 
because there would be no room at 
the Inn because you and Pied Piper 
are here gumming up the works.  See 
what I’m saying Thomas?
THOMAS
That Steve Jobs is Jesus?

7
6.
ERLICH
He was Buddist!
THOMAS
He was a poser!  He didn’t even 
write code.
Erlich looks stunned -- this is the only thing that could 
shut him up.
EXT. LUXURY SHUTTLE VAN - MORNING
Thomas rides the luxury shuttle van to work with Big Head. 
The Boodle Channel plays on closed circuit TVs and on it we 
see GAVIN BELSON, CIO (Chief Innovation Officer) of Boodle 
and a true running sore of a human being.  He talks about how 
Boodle is making the world a better place.
GAVIN BELSON (V.O.)
Boodle brings the world to 
everyone.  Boodle is everything.  
And that’s what allows Boodle to 
“make happy.”
Gavin then urges his workers to sit back and relax (but also 
be sure to enjoy the complimentary energy bars and energy 
drinks and energy gum onboard).  We see everyone chomping and 
drinking away as the channel then shows all the ways Boodle 
“Makes Happy”.
Thomas is on his iPad looking at rentals.
THOMAS
These rents are insane.  $2800 a 
month, $4500 a month -- with five 
people!  
BIG HEAD
You forget how goddamn expensive it 
is here.  
Thomas looks miserable.
THOMAS
I don’t want to have to go back to 
St. Louis.  I can barely talk to 
people in St. Louis.  My parents 
still live in St. Louis! 
BIG HEAD
You think Oklahoma City’s any 
better?  
(MORE)

7.
BIG HEAD (CONT'D)
And I’m going to be the next one 
booted.  Ever since GoolyBib landed 
two million in seed money Erlich’s 
been on the warpath about 
monetizing.
THOMAS
GoolyBib?  That Indian guy from 
Dropbox you were hanging out with?
BIG HEAD
No, it’s a startup -- GoolyBib.  I 
think it’s a real estate app... or
maybe it’s that traffic one.
THOMAS
Fuck.  Every day somebody in the 
valley is hitting it big. But not 
me. If I can’t pull it off now, 
when there are billions of dollars 
just LOOKING FOR A START UP, it 
might not ever happen.
BIG HEAD
Yeah, no kidding.
THOMAS
What are you worried about?  Erlich 
loves Nip Alert.
BIG HEAD
He’s just blinded by boobs.  Once 
he scratches the surface he’s going 
to see there’s giant holes in this 
thing.  It’s based on self 
reporting. I can’t put sensors on 
women to report when their nipples 
are erect.  I get one clown to send 
out fake reports and the whole 
thing collapses.  I need something 
to make it objective.
Thomas has calmed down now that he has a problem to focus on.
THOMAS
Maybe I could develop an image 
recognition program, kind of like 
the melody recognition in Pied 
Piper.  
Big Head is coming around.

9
8.
BIG HEAD
Or infra red cameras that detect  
changes in body heat.
They are both sold for the moment. But it soon fades.
THOMAS
Fuck, I’m going to have to go to 
graduate school.  I can’t afford to  
stay here even if I’m working full 
time at Boodle.  
Thomas looks down at the TV where Gavin Belson is still 
talking.
GAVIN BELSON (V.O.)
That is how Boodle can change the 
world.
THOMAS
Changing the world, one crappy app
at a time.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BOODLE - MOMENTS LATER
Thomas and Big Head walk through the Boodle campus.  They 
pass by the “play area” -- climbing walls, paintball obstacle 
course, fitness stations, all of which are being unused as 
engineers stand around drinking energy drinks.
Big Head is clearly lost in thought.  He turns to Thomas.
BIG HEAD
Hey, did you hear what Peter 
Gregory is doing?
THOMAS
You mean buying that island in the 
Pacific?
BIG HEAD
He’s building one actually. It’s 
gonna be this giant platform in the 
middle of the ocean. And I think 
he’s designing a new monetary 
system for it.  But anyway, he’s 
also offering a hundred K to people 
willing to skip or drop of college 
to pursue any idea they have.  I 
mean, it has to be really kick ass.

10
9.
THOMAS
Pied Piper kicks ass.  
BIG HEAD
He’s speaking in Palo Alto tonight.  
We should go. See if they’ll let us 
talk to him.
(musing)
I don’t know what happened to that 
guy, but he really hates college.
Thomas considers this idea.  Big Head eats another energy 
bar.  He’s wired, tapping his hands, moving his legs.
BIG HEAD (CONT’D)
Fuck, I don’t know if it’s the 
energy bar or drink or gum but I 
can’t wait for tonight.  And I 
can’t sit still.
INT. BOODLE - DAY
Thomas gets out of his cubicle. It is painted bright colors 
and has a rounded shape to the sides but it is still a 
cubicle.  He gets up and walks over to a nearby snack area.
SNACK AREA - This place has large glass-cased refrigerators 
filled with anything with caffeine in it.  They also have 
fountain drinks.  Thomas is making himself an energy “swamp 
water” by putting a little bit of each drink into his cup 
when two douchey programmers or “brogrammers” stroll up and 
start using the Auto Barrista. (These guys act like frat guys 
and clearly only work out their upper bodies and thereby 
succeed only in making themselves look odder -- they have 
huge biceps and skinny legs).
Thomas mutters to himself with disdain.
THOMAS
Brogrammers.
BROGRAMMER #1
A double machiatto for me.
He presses a button.
BROGRAMMER #2
Make mine a double double.
BROGRAMMER #1
Yeah!

11
10.
They are very happy with themselves.  Brogrammer #1 one has 
large side burns that actually meet under his chin.  
Brogrammer #2 grabs Thomas’s skinny arm..
BROGRAMMER #2
Hey, To-mas -- you been working 
out?
The brogrammers laugh at this.  Brogrammer #1 then gives 
Thomas a chin up nod.
BROGRAMMER #1
So how is every little thing?
THOMAS
Eh... not so good.  Gotta find a 
place to live, so if you guys know 
of anything...
BROGRAMMER #2
You’re leaving the Hacker Hostel?
THOMAS
Getting kicked out. I’ve got a 
website that I think could be huge, 
but nobody gets it.  
These guys look very interested.
BROGRAMMER #1
We might get it.  We’d love to take 
a look.  What’s it called?
THOMAS
Pied Piper.
The brogrammers try not to laugh but they are giddy.  Thomas 
is oblivious to their snarkiness.
BROGRAMMER #1
Sounds amazing.  Why don’t you 
shoot it over to me and we’ll give 
it a look.  Maybe we can help.
Thomas eagerly opens his laptop.  As soon as he hits “send” 
he looks up and sees their smirking faces.  Clearly, they are 
just fucking with him.  He sags, closes his laptop and 
trudges off.
INT. FOUR SEASONS PALO ALTO - EVENING
A large crowd watches as Peter Gregory gives a speech.  
Gregory comes across as a very focused accountant.  

12
11.
No matter what inflammatory thing he’s saying, or what 
epithets people are throwing at him, he never gets agitated.
PETER GREGORY
Gates, Ellison, Jobs, Dell. All 
dropped out of college.  Silicon 
Valley is the cradle of innovation 
because of DROP OUTS. We need 
innovation and we need innovators!  
Colleges are choking and strangling 
with conformity what the drop outs 
created through inspiration! 
We see Thomas and Big Head watching from the audience.
PETER GREGORY (CONT’D)
College has become a cruel, 
expensive joke on the poor and the 
middle class that only benefits the 
perpetrators of it -- the bloated 
administrations and the myopic 
teaching staffs.  Wages for 
graduates are going down. 
Employment opportunities for 
graduates are shrinking, but the 
cost of a “higher education” just 
keeps going up and up and up.   
The audience laughs in agreement but A BEARDED ACADEMIC looks 
fit to be tied.  He yells out.
BEARDED ACADEMIC
You are a dangerous man, spewing 
ignorance!  
PETER GREGORY
I don’t think so. I’m just saying 
that people should trust themselves 
more than a system that happily 
churns out unemployed debtors and 
provides dubious value.
BEARDED ACADEMIC
The true value of a college 
education is intangible.
PETER GREGORY
The true value of snake-oil is 
intangible as well.
The audience laughs again.

13
12.
PETER GREGORY (CONT’D)
If you have a truly unique and 
brilliant idea I can promise you 
that any university worth its 
weight will crush it with their 
lack of creative thought and your 
now monumental pile of debt.
The Academic gets up and storms out.
BEARDED ACADEMIC
Fascist.
EXT. FOUR SEASONS PALO ALTO - LATER
Peter Gregory waits for his car.  With him is his Head of 
Operations, a very attractive, smart woman named MONICA.
Thomas approaches them with Big Head in tow.  (Big Head is 
mesmerized, staring at Monica’s chest).
THOMAS
Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory?  I have 
an idea I’d love to pitch--
Monica cuts him off.
MONICA
There were sign up sheets to have a 
personal consultation with Mr. 
Gregory.
THOMAS
There weren’t any slots left.
MONICA
I’m sorry.
Thomas nods but he clearly has a plan.
THOMAS
I just thought I should talk to him 
before I give up and... go back to 
college.
PETER GREGORY
Don’t!  Wait, where?
THOMAS
I don’t know, probably Boston 
University.
Peter is practically spitting.

14
13.
PETER GREGORY
That’s over fifty thousand a year.  
Do not do that.  Go work at Burger 
King.  Go into the woods and forage 
for nuts and berries.  But do not 
go back to college!
At that moment, Peter notices that Thomas is smiling 
slightly, maybe a little too happy with himself.
PETER GREGORY (CONT’D)
I think I have been played.  Fine.  
Go ahead and pitch. You have until 
I fasten the seatbelt in my car.
Thomas was ready and jumps right in.
THOMAS
Pied Piper is a proprietary site 
that allows you to find if your 
music is infringing on existing 
copyrights.  Imagine if you were a 
song writer.... 
Peter is lost.
PETER GREGORY
I don’t think I could write a song.
THOMAS
But if you did...
PETER GREGORY
I don’t even know if I can say 
“Pied Piper is a proprietary site.”  
Well I guess I just did but it 
wasn’t easy.
Thomas is clearly thrown by Peter’s odd manner.  At that 
moment Peter’s car pull up.  Thomas is about to pitch some 
more but Monica steps between them.  
MONICA
Crunching all those songs to find 
matches sounds like a lot of data 
flow.
This gives Peter a graceful exit.
PETER GREGORY
Yes.  Yes it does.

15
14.
It is then that we notice his “car” -- it’s a futuristic 
Volkswagen personal mobility transporter concept car.  He 
hops in and “hovers” away.  Thomas is crushed.
MONICA
Look, why don’t you send me the 
link for your project and we’ll 
take a look.
THOMAS
Great, if you give me your email
address I’ll send you the link.
MONICA
(slightest beat)
Why don’t you just write it down 
for me.
Thomas is certain he's just being shined on so she can get 
out of there, but writes down the info and hands it to her.  
Big Head is still just staring at her chest.  He notices 
Monica noticing.
BIG HEAD
Sorry.. I’m just thinking about... 
image recognition.
INT. HACKER HOUSE - NIGHT
Thomas, defeated, comes home to find Erlich slurping ramen 
and listening to people pitch their ideas so they can get 
Thomas’s room. (NOTE: When Erlich eats ramen he clips his 
hair back).
ERLICH
...the airlines had a problem, and 
I had Accutran.  So... wow me.  
The pitcher starts pitching.
PITCHER
Ok, here it is:  Bit Soup.  It’s 
like alphaBET soup but it’s all 
ones and zeroes. 
Everyone waits expectantly but Erlich just stares at the 
pitcher.  The pitcher fidgets.  Then:
PITCHER (CONT’D)
(hopefully)
See it’s binary.  Because binary is 
just ones and zeroes

16
15.
ERLICH
I KNOW WHAT BINARY IS!!! Jesus!  
I’ve memorized the hexadecimal 
times tables! Ask me what 9 times F 
is!! I don’t need you to tell me 
what’s binary and I don’t NEED you 
thinking about soup.  I NEED you 
thinking about code.  This is 
Silicon Valley, not...
He pauses a second as he punches something into his iPad.
ERLICH (CONT’D)
...Paris, Texas.
(beat)
That’s where Campbell’s Soup is.
Erlich sees Thomas, then pointedly turns to the nerds.
ERLICH (CONT’D)
Look, I got one slot opening up 
very soon, who’s gonna get it?
As Thomas retreats to his room we hear the nerds pitching a 
battery of tech words like “capacity” and “battery”.  
INT. HACKER HOUSE - THOMAS’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Thomas enters his room to find Big Head talking with Dinesh 
and Roland.  Big Head holds a sacbut, which is an old brass 
instrument that sort of resembles a trombone.
ROLAND
So that thing is from the 1400s?
BIG HEAD
Not this one literally, but the 
sacbut is the least evolutionized
of all brass instruments, so it 
would be the same as one from the 
14th century.
DINESH
So do you guys play anywhere?  Like 
clubs or anything?
Big Head uses his sacbut to point at Dinesh.
BIG HEAD
Not yet.  We’re trying to play 
Street Fair this year.  
(MORE)

17
16.
BIG HEAD (CONT'D)
Problem is, they’re more into 
traditional Sacbut, which we can 
do, but it seems like it would be 
selling out or something -- just 
doing what people expect.
ROLAND
I don’t think anyone ever expects a 
sacbut ensemble anywhere...
THOMAS
Everyone likes music.  I can’t 
figure out what it is about Pied 
Piper that people don’t get?
DINESH
Applicability?
THOMAS
I don’t know... Peter Gregory’s 
head of operations said to send her 
the link but she was probably just 
shining me on.
DINESH/ROLAND
She?
BIG HEAD
Man, she was hot.
ROLAND
Why didn’t I see her on nip alert?
BIG HEAD
Because I was too distracted.  See, 
that’s another bug I have to work 
out.
Big Head looks around nervously to make sure Erlich didn’t 
hear that.
CUT TO:
EXT. LOS ANGELES - ESTABLISHING
INT. YOGA STUDIO - DAY
Two very attractive women, LANGDON and TANDY, are doing yoga 
at the back of the class.  Tandy looks likes she could be a 
model, but probably just swimsuit or lingerie; Langdon has 
more of a classic beauty.  (This place is almost depressingly 
filled with hot, young women and one guy.)

18
17.
LANGDON
This is probably the worst time 
ever to be a laid-off publicist. 
TANDY
Yep.  Social media.
LANGDON
I know!  There are no cool jobs 
anymore because everyone is out 
there blogging and doing it for 
free!  At least you’re working non-
profit.
TANDY
I’m working the phones for 
mesothelioma for ten bones an hour 
and there are no parties.  No 
galas. No deep pockets. No 
connections. 
Langdon shakes her head.
LANGDON
Remember those Pediatric AIDS fund-
raisers?  Those were huge.
TANDY
Yeah, that’s how I met Jerry 
Weintraub.  He took me to Cannes.  
God, I miss the Hotel Du Cap.
Tandy and Langdon adjust positions.
LANGDON
There’s just no money in non-
profits anymore.  Then I guess 
there’s no money anywhere anymore.  
And I need a job.
(shakes her head)
I’m in way default on my student 
loans.  Why the hell did they lend 
me money to major in Art History. 
Assholes!!
Tandy has an explanation.
TANDY
It’s fucked up.  Wanna go to Vespio
tonight?

19
18.
LANGDON
I don’t know, we keep running into 
the same guys.  All the guys with 
money in LA seem to be old and fat.
TANDY
Except for the professional 
athletes.
LANGDON
Yeah, they’re hot but they’re all 
rapists.
TANDY
(like it’s even worse)
Yeah, or Christians.
LANGDON
I would even settle for a guy who 
wasn’t rich as long as he wasn’t a 
douche.
TANDY
Keep telling yourself that.  I 
think you would be bored to death. 
My mom always says it’s just as 
easy to fall in love with a rich 
guy as a poor guy.  
LANGDON
Not around here...
The class ends.  They roll up their yoga mats, sling their 
towels over their shoulders and heads towards the adjoining 
cafe.
INT. YOGA STUDIO - CAFE - MOMENTS LATER
Langdon and Tandy head into the adjoining cafe where they 
serve teas and herbal drinks.  
TANDY
I really should have married Tom 
when I had the chance.  I’d be 
living in a house in Malibu.  I 
wouldn’t be worried about getting 
older.  I’ve seen lines on my face. 
Well, just around the eyes, but 
they are there. 

20
19.
LANGDON
Eyes aren’t as hard to fix as necks 
and hands but... Yeah, I’m not even 
getting carded anymore.  
A TV is tuned to an MSNBC show about young rich Silicon 
Valley guys. 
LANGDON (CONT’D)
Why can’t we meet guys like that?
TANDY
Geeks?
LANGDON
Yeah.  They’re rich and smart and 
they’re our age.
TANDY
(being swayed)
Yeah, and they don’t look rapey. 
But they’re all up North.  
Langdon considers this a beat.  
LANGDON
So a half hour plane ride away 
there’s all these gazillionaires?  
What the hell are we doing here?
TANDY
Getting older.  And poorer.  
They look to each other then back to the TV.
CUT TO:
CLOSE UP OF A COMPUTER
We see the Pied Piper Logo.  It's pretty bad as far as logos 
go.  PULL BACK to see we are
INT. BOODLE - DAY
The brogrammers who Thomas pitched Pied Piper to are calling 
up the site to make fun of it.
BROGRAMMER #1
Let’s look at this stupid thing.

21
20.
BROGRAMMER #2
(snarky)
You have to download your own 
player?  Hey look at me, I traveled 
back to 2009!
A song starts playing.  Brogrammer #1’s smirk suddenly turns 
into a look of surprise.  
BROGRAMMER #1
Wait a second.  Look at this file 
size.  1.2 Megabytes?  No way!  I 
know that song.  That’s at least 3 
on itunes...
He starts playing it.
BROGRAMMER #2
Wow, that doesn’t sound at all 
downgraded.
DISSOLVE TO:
SAME SCENE -- MOMENTS LATER
They are testing the software, comparing file sizes, etc.
BROGRAMMER #1
I really can’t hear the difference.    
BROGRAMMER #2
And the file size is like, half.  
How the hell did he do that?
BROGRAMMER #1
I have no idea.  Some kind of new 
lossy compression I guess. 
DISSOLVE TO:
SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
A larger crowd has now gathered around to look at Pied Piper.  
We see that someone has plugged large speakers into the 
computer.  Music is playing but nobody is really listening, 
they’re just glued to the computer.  Everyone is asking 
various questions about how many bytes and what the 
compression is.
Brogrammer #1 and Brogrammer #2 look at each other,  They are 
humbled and impressed.  Just then, a young business exec, 
JARED DUNN, walks by and sees everyone gathered around.  

22
21.
JARED
What are you guys listening to?
BROGRAMMER #1
We’re listening to 1.5 gigabytes of 
sound that should take up 4.5 
gigabytes.
Jared leans in, intrigued.
CUT TO:
THE PERPETUALLY SCOWLING FACE OF GAVIN BELSON
He strides down a corridor of Boodle.  Jared tries to keep up 
while showing him Pied Piper on his laptop.
JARED
Do you realize how huge this could 
be?  With all the data storage and 
data flow problems.  The 
applications could be endless.
As Gavin watches it, he stops walking.  His scowl changes 
into an expression of pure greed.
GAVIN BELSON
I want it.
INT. HACKER HOUSE - DAY
Thomas has got his stuff all packed up.  Big Head holds some 
of it.  Thomas is arguing with Erlich over the various and 
seemingly arbitrary move-out obligations he is insisting 
Thomas takes on.
ERLICH
Hey, I’m being a good guy here.  
You can either get me a zip drive 
with any and all code you worked on 
or thought of working on while you 
lived here, or you can just clean 
the bathroom.  Up to you.
Erlich leaves Thomas and takes a seat in front of an eager 
young guy who is ready to pitch.  Thomas’s phone rings.  He 
looks at it and turns to Big Head.
THOMAS
A Boodle number again.  It’s 
probably those fucking brogrammers.

23
22.
Big Head nods at this then puts the tip of his thumb up 
against his lips and blows -- with each blow he pretends his 
upper body is inflating in a crude imitation of the 
brogrammers.
THOMAS (CONT’D)
They keep calling to tell me how 
bad my website is.  I really don’t 
want to answer just to hear about 
what an asshole I am.
ANGLE ON ERLICH
He turns to the eager guy.
ERLICH
You’re on.
EAGER GUY
My site is called Mashville.
ANGLE ON THOMAS
His phone rings again.  It’s a Boodle number again.
THOMAS
(sighs)
I just want to put an end to this.
(answers)
Hi, Thomas Peckering, I’m an 
asshole, tell me how much you hate 
Pied Piper.
His expression changes.
THOMAS (CONT’D)
What?  Really?  Wait, is this a 
prank?  Can you prove it’s real?  
OK, I’ll call right back.
This has gotten everyone’s attention.  They watch as Thomas 
calls back the number.
THOMAS (CONT’D)
Holy shit.  OK... I’ll be there.
He hangs up.
THOMAS (CONT’D)
I have a meeting with Gavin 
Belson... he likes Pied Piper.
The housemates are all freaking out.  Erlich steps away from 
the guy pitching him and walks up to Thomas.

24
23.
ERLICH
I own ten percent of Pied Piper.
THOMAS
You said it was a shitty idea.
ERLICH
It was a shitty idea.  I’m not sure 
what it is now.  When’s your 
meeting?
THOMAS
Right now.
ERLICH
I’ll go change.
Erlich hurries off.  Thomas waits for a beat then turns to 
Big Head.
THOMAS
What the fuck am I waiting for?
Thomas hurries out.
EXT. BOODLE - LATER
Thomas is admitted to the executive area.
INT. BOODLE - MOMENTS LATER
Thomas sits in the waiting area.  Jared and a bunch of other 
EXECUTIVES are with him.
JARED
Good to see you, Thomas.  Now Gavin 
is running about thirty minutes 
late.
THOMAS
Well, it’s been forty minutes 
already so does that mean another 
30 minutes from now then...?
The other exec chimes in.
OTHER EXECUTIVE
You should know Gavin is very 
excited about your site.  Have you 
met Gavin?

25
24.
THOMAS
I’ve never even seen him in person.
The other executive steps in.  The exec has the glow of a 
cult member talking about a cult leader.
OTHER EXECUTIVE
It’s amazing.  You’ll just feel so 
energized after you meet him.  I’m 
a VP here and I only see Gavin 
about ten minutes a month. 
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
But that ten minutes is just 
incredible.  Indescribable.  
Prepare to have your life changed.
A door opens and another SENIOR VP enters.
SENIOR VP
I heard Thomas Peckering was here.  
Has he ever met Gavin?  No?  
OTHER EXECUTIVE
I told him it’s amazing.
SENIOR VP
That hardly begins to describe it.
INT. BOODLE - GAVIN BELSON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
A huge office.  There are giant pictures all over the place -- 
and they are all of Gavin: Gavin in a hard hat pointing at a 
giant crane as if he’s telling it what to do, Gavin dressed 
in his judo gi in full action pose, Gavin standing amidst a 
group of starving people in Nepal, his hands outstretched 
benevolently.  WE WIDEN to see that Gavin is in his office 
with a designer who is pointing out the window at a huge 
blank wall in the entryway to Boodle.  
DESIGNER
We really need to do something to 
fill that huge space up there.  Now 
I know you won’t like this idea, 
Gavin, but how about a nice, bold 
picture of you to fill it?
Gavin sighs and nods.
GAVIN BELSON
OK.  But I don’t want to just pose 
this time.  Maybe we can get a shot 
of me... innovating.

26
25.
The designer clearly has no idea what this will look like.
DESIGNER
Perfect.
EXT. BOODLE - CONTINUOUS
Erlich, now in a fresh blue “I know HTML -- How To Meet 
Ladies” T-shirt, freshly waxed mustache, and what seems to be 
a Greek fisherman’s cap, is shoving Big Head in front of him.  
Big Head uses his pass card to get them in.
INT. BOODLE - CONTINUOUS
Thomas still waits with Jared and the other executives.  
Gavin is still not there but they’re all still talking about 
him.
SENIOR VP
(satisfied sigh)
Ah, Gavin...
Thomas’s phone rings.  He excuses himself to answer.
THOMAS
Hello?
His expression slowly turns to one of shock.  He looks up at 
the others.
THOMAS (CONT’D)
It’s Peter Gregory.
The executives and Jared exchange a troubled look.  The 
Senior VP excuses himself and rushes out.
INT. BOODLE - GAVIN BELSON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Gavin is now meeting with two Powerade reps.  Gavin is 
looking out the window at programmers in the courtyard below.
GAVIN BELSON
It’s weird.  They always travel in 
groups of five.  Tall skinny white 
guy, short skinny Asian guy, fat 
guy with a ponytail, some guy with 
crazy facial hair and then an east 
Indian guy.  Do they trade guys 
till they all have the right group?

27
26.
POWERADE REP
Ummm... I’m not sure, but we are 
very excited about becoming the 
official energy product of Boodle 
Corporation.  You know our products 
are not just junk loaded with sugar 
and caffeine.  I mean of course 
they have those but they really are 
an excellent nutritional product.
GAVIN BELSON
When I first started Boodle I 
worked those guys 24/7.  It’s 
amazing what you can get human 
beings to do for $45 worth of ice 
cream.  But the thing is, now 
everyone wants to be healthy...
At that moment the Senior VP rushes in and whispers to Gavin.  
He turns to the Powerade reps.
GAVIN BELSON (CONT’D)
Get the fuck out.
INT. BOODLE - MOMENTS LATER
Thomas is still talking to Peter Gregory on the phone.
THOMAS
I’m actually outside Gavin Belson’s 
office right now, Mr. Gregory.  
Here he is!  Can you hold on a 
second?
Gavin strides in.
GAVIN BELSON
So, Thomas Peckering is here!  
Gavin is looking at an overweight guy with a pony tail until 
Jared guides him over to Thomas.  Gavin acts like he has just 
found a long lost friend.  
GAVIN BELSON (CONT’D)
There you are, Tom!! I’m sorry 
these gentlemen kept you waiting.
He gives Jared and the other executives dirty looks.  They do 
their best to look apologetic.  
GAVIN BELSON (CONT’D)
Here’s the thing -- I love what you 
did.

28
27.
THOMAS
You REALLY like Pied Piper?
GAVIN BELSON
LOVE IT!  Fill him in Jared!
Jared steps in.
JARED
Now, Thomas, of course since you 
developed this fantastic project on 
the Boodle campus while employed by 
Boodle, technically it is the 
property of Boodle, but Gavin is 
prepared to give you quite a nice 
raise - and a promotion of course.
THOMAS
Oh, well actually I’ve only worked 
here at Boodle a few weeks.  I 
needed a job because things weren’t 
panning out and... well I created 
this site months before I got here.
ERLICH (O.S.)
That’s right!  He created it while 
living AT MY INCUBATOR.
They all turn to see Erlich and Big Head coming.  Big Head 
whispers to Thomas.
BIG HEAD
Sorry, he threatened to kick me out 
of the house if I didn’t get him 
in.
ERLICH
(to Belson)
Scott Erlich.
Gavin ignores him, he is clearly figuring out a new way to  
navigate the situation.  He nods and looks as fatherly and 
comforting as possible as he speaks to Thomas.
GAVIN BELSON
I’ll give you $600,000 for it. 
Thomas, Big Head and Erlich are shocked, but Erlich puts his 
arm around Thomas as if he owns him.  Thomas is stunned, a 
grin slowly spreading across his face.  

29
28.
GAVIN BELSON (CONT’D)
But I am not just giving you 
$600,000, I am giving you the full 
weight of Boodle.  We have the 
reach and the muscle and the 
resources to take what you have 
done and push it to the global 
level. At Boodle we don’t ask 
people what they want.  We tell 
them what they want. And they thank 
us for doing it. Boodle can bring 
you the world.
Big Head’s phone ring.  He answers it.
BIG HEAD
Hello?  Really?  Wow.  Sure.
He hands his phone to Thomas.
BIG HEAD (CONT’D)
It’s Peter Gregory.  I don’t know 
how he got my number.
Thomas takes the phone.
THOMAS
Hello, Mr. Gregory, I’m so sorry.  
Oh, you heard that? 
(listening)
Uh huh... Uh huh...
GAVIN BELSON
(blurts)
I’ll give you ten million dollars 
for it!
The room goes dead silent.  Thomas is in shock.  He speaks 
half to himself/half into the phone.
THOMAS
Gavin Belson just offered me 10 
million dollars for Pied Piper.
CUT TO:
PETER GREGORY
In his office with Monica standing by.  They have Thomas on 
speaker phone.  Peter seems unimpressed.

30
29.
PETER GREGORY
Ten million?  I’m prepared to give 
you one hundred thousand dollars.
CUT TO:
THOMAS
Overwhelmed with stunned joy.
THOMAS
(to Gavin and the others)
Peter Gregory offered me one 
hundred...
(realizing)
...thousand?
CUT TO:
PETER GREGORY
PETER GREGORY
File size is a problem that is 
never going away.  That makes your  
compression code very valuable.  
Ask yourself this, Thomas:  Did you 
come out to Silicon Valley to make 
ten million dollars and disappear?  
Or did you come to make billions 
and leave your mark? You could be 
up there with the greats. 
Thomas tries to process this but just looks like he's in 
clinical shock.  Then something occurs to him.  He turns to 
Gavin.
THOMAS
Mr. Belson, I have a great idea!  
Peter Gregory is only interested in 
the compression algorithm I 
created, so I could do Pied Piper 
with you and develop the 
compression technology with him.
GAVIN BELSON
(explodes)
The compression is the only thing 
about the fucking stupid site I DO 
WANT!!
Gavin comes up to him.

31
30.
GAVIN BELSON (CONT’D)
Don’t be an idiot.  I’m offering 
you real money.  Ten million, right 
now.  
Everyone is peppering Thomas with advice.  His head is 
swimming.  
THOMAS
Excuse me... I...I need to use the 
bathroom... 
Thomas walks off.  We follow him past the men’s room and down 
corridors and dead ends.  He’s trying to get out but can’t.  
He finally breaks free and runs.
CUT TO:
A SERIES OF PHONE CALLS AND MEETINGS
--Thomas and all the hacker house residents sit around the 
kitchen table.  Everyone peppers him with advice. 
--Thomas is sitting behind the desk in a big private office 
at Boodle.  Jared and the other execs surround him.  Thomas 
seems excited but overwhelmed.
THOMAS
So what would my position with the 
company be?
JARED
Your position?
THOMAS
What would I be doing?
SENIOR VP
You could just think of something 
else genius.
THOMAS
And you guys would own it?
SENIOR VP
Well, yes, as per the terms of the 
contract. But--
He motions to a very thick contract in front of Thomas.

32
31.
THOMAS
Yeah, I meant to ask you about 
that, this contract is for thirty 
years.
SENIOR VP
Yes, the ten million is paid over 
thirty years.
All the execs nod happily as if this is the best news ever.  
Thomas spots something else and points to a paragraph in the 
contract.
THOMAS
This looks like a restraining 
order.
JARED
Yes, well, Gavin is a very busy 
man... and he doesn’t want to get 
in your way... or you in his.
(mutters quietly)
It's not necessarily a bad thing.
As Thomas looks through the voluminous document, we see his 
excitement fading.
EXT. HACKER HOUSE - EVENING
Thomas is lost in thought as he walks onto the front stoop.  
He is about to try the door when something catches the corner 
of his eye.  He turns and sees Monica is sitting there 
waiting for him.  He practically jumps in surprise.  Monica 
can’t help but laugh.  She is dressed casually now and 
although she still has a professional polish to her she is 
much more accessible than when in her normal business attire.
MONICA
Whoa, someone’s on edge.
Thomas tries to regain his composure.
THOMAS
Yeah, maybe.  Wonder why.
MONICA
Well, I came by to let you know 
that whoever you go with, 
everything will be just fine. 
Boodle is creepy and Peter is... 
well nuts, but you have two of the 
biggest players in Silicon Valley 
fighting over you.  Enjoy it.

33
32.
THOMAS
Yeah, I don’t see that happening. I 
have to make the most important 
decision of my life! And I’m not 
good at making those kinds of 
decisions.
Monica moves over on the bench to make room for Thomas and 
gestures for him to sit next to her but he doesn’t seem to 
notice.  She nods slightly like “okay then”.
MONICA
So, what kind of decisions are you 
good at making?
Thomas thinks about this.
THOMAS
Technical ones.  Fixes.  Cracking 
code and making it work.  And then 
making it work better.  I like 
having discreet reducible problems 
and solving them.  I’m not much of 
a “big picture guy”.
MONICA
Maybe you are and maybe you aren’t.  
Maybe you just need bigger problems 
to solve.
Thomas gets an ironic smile.
THOMAS
So, Peter Gregory sent you here to 
offer me bigger problems?
Monica gets up and moves towards Thomas.  Thomas practically 
holds his breath as she brushes past him.  She lingers for a 
second and looks him right in the eye.
MONICA
Nobody sent me over here.
And then she walks away.
MONICA (CONT’D)
When you don’t try to see the “big 
picture” you miss a lot.  Even 
things that are right in front of 
you.
And with that she walks down the steps and away. Thomas 
watches her, she turns her head to see him as she gets to her 
car.  He doesn’t know what to do so he just waves.  

34
33.
Monica sighs and waves back as she gets into her car. She is 
smiling.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GAVIN BELSON’S OFFICE - DAY
All of the execs we have met before are standing around 
anxiously while Gavin talks on the speaker phone. 
THOMAS (V.O.)
I’ve been thinking about this a 
lot, and I think Boodle is a great 
opportunity, but I’m a little fuzzy 
about just what exactly I would do.
Gavin jumps on this but tries to sound pleasant.
GAVIN BELSON
You can do anything, learn to play 
zithers, play D&D all day long.  
Hell, grow a pony tail, grow 
pigtails, I don’t care.
Gavin is clearly getting revved up.  Jared motions him to 
calm down.
JARED
What Gavin is saying is that you’ll 
have complete freedom.
WE NOW INTERCUT WITH THOMAS IN HIS ROOM PACING WHILE TALKING 
ON HIS CELL PHONE.
THOMAS
Well, it’s just that I kind of want 
to be a part of something.  I want 
to help take this to the next 
level.  So I was thinking maybe if 
we became partners...
Gavin reacts to “partners” and turns to Jared.
GAVIN BELSON
I'm willing to give this dickhead
thirty million dollars if I never 
have to talk to him again!
JARED
(whispers)
Gavin, we’re still on speakerphone.

35
34.
GAVIN BELSON
I know!
And with that Gavin violently hangs up.
CUT TO:
EXT. FOUR SEASONS PALO ALTO - EVENING
Langdon and Tandy pull up, dressed to kill.
INT. FOUR SEASONS PALO ALTO - LATER
Langdon and Tandy are at the bar, baffled by this place.  
There are some khaki pant wearing businessmen. Lots of 
Asians, lots of glasses and lots of Ipads and notebook 
computers.  Everyone seems to be working like this is just 
another office.
LANGDON
It looks like a Four Seasons but 
sure as hell doesn’t feel like one.
The presence of Langdon and Tandy has registered -- they are 
attractive women anywhere but here they are almost like from 
another planet. Guys actually stop working to look at them, 
but whenever Langdon or Tandy simply make eye contact with a 
guy he becomes completely flustered, turns away and stares 
intently at whatever screen he has handy.  Tandy looks beyond 
confused.  
TANDY
OK, I have never felt less sexual 
energy in my life.
At that moment, a hopelessly nerdy GUY stumbles up to them.  
Clearly he is really stinking drunk, can’t handle liquor, and 
awkwardly tries to hit on them..
GUY
Hey girls.  My name’s James.
(hands them his card)
I started Zcranium.com. We just got 
two million in start up money.
TANDY
Oh really?  So you’re like, a 
programmer or...?
GUY
(insulted for no reason)
Fuck yeah!  
(MORE)

36
35.
GUY (CONT'D)
I was writing code when I was 8. I 
was a math wizz Sergie Brin?!  
Larry PAGE?!! Fucking Larry 
Elllison??!!! They’re NOTHING!
Langdon and Tandy are stunned.  At that moment a Hotel 
Security Guard comes over and grabs the guy by the collar and 
leads him out as he rants. 
GUY (CONT’D)
I’m a tenth level magic user!!!
CUT TO:
EXT. DOWNTOWN PALO ALTO - EVENING
Langdon and Tandy stand in the middle of downtown Palo Alto.  
They look around at the bland, mundane quality of the cars, 
shops and people walking around.
TANDY
This is it?  This is where all the 
tech billionaires decided to live?
LANGDON
It can’t be.
(stops a passerby)
Excuse me, is this Palo Alto?
The person nods and walks on.  Langdon notices a Brew Pub.  
She nods for Tandy to follow her.
INT. BREW PUB - MOMENTS LATER
Langdon and Tandy walk through the Brew Pub.  Guys are 
looking at them but it is that same flustered/terrified vibe
from before.  
LANGDON
It looks like it’s all guys.  
That’s gotta be good, right?
They come up to the bar where Roland and Jin Yiang are deep 
in conversation.  Jin Yiang looks angry and is oblivious to 
the women, but Roland spots them and tries to play it cool as 
Jin Yiang pays the tab.
JIN YIANG
This bullshit.  Why I gotta buy 
beers?  That motherfucker just get 
30 million dollars from Boodle.

37
36.
This immediately catches Langdon’s attention.  Roland tries 
to sound cool, which sadly for him comes out sounding a bit 
like John Wayne.
ROLAND
Cause you never pay for shit, Jin
Yiang.  And this is a big night for 
Thomas.
JIAN YANG
(confused)
Why you talk fucked up like that? 
ROLAND
(gritted teeth)
Just c’mon.
Embarrassed, Roland pushes Jin Yiang ahead of him.  Langdon 
watches them walk across the bar to a a group of guys heading 
out.  In the center of the group is Thomas.  He is surrounded 
by his housemates and other tech geeks, everyone still giving 
him advice or just coming over to shake his hand.  Langdon 
watches as they head for the door.
LANGDON
(to herself)
Thomas.
Tandy has been oblivious to all this.  She’s had enough.
TANDY
We can still catch the late flight 
back to LA.
Langdon shakes her head, never taking her eyes off Thomas.
LANGDON
We’re not going anywhere.
INT. HACKER HOUSE - NIGHT
It’s late at night and Thomas sits all alone in the kitchen, 
clearly conflicted.  Erlich comes in and starts making 
instant noodle ramen.  Thomas is waiting for a jackass remark 
from Erlich as he sits down next to him but Erlich just clips 
back his hair and starts eating his ramen.  After a beat 
Erlich looks up at Thomas.
ERLICH
You don't want to work for assholes
and now you don't have to.   You're 
like me - you want to build 
something.

38
37.
Erlich goes back to slurping down his noodle ramen. Thomas 
looks surprised by Erlich's comment but then almost relieved.
INT. BOODLE - DAY
Gavin looks like he is about to have an aneurism as he hangs 
up the phone.  Jared shakes his head in disbelief.
JARED
He turned down 30 million dollars?
Gavin shakes his head.
GAVIN BELSON
Well, look at it this way -- I have 
30 million dollars that I’m going 
to use to destroy that sad, 
pathetic, stupid prick.
This thought seems to cheer Gavin.
INT. HACKER HOUSE - EVENING
Thomas, Erlich, Big Head and the other hacker house residents 
celebrate with pizza and beer.
THOMAS
With this new company we’re really 
going to try and do things right.  
First order of business -- changing 
the name.  
(off their looks)
Yes, I know “Pied Piper” sucks.
They all laugh and toast.  Just then, Jared enters.
THOMAS (CONT’D)
Oh... Hey.  I turned down you guys.  
And my decision is final.
JARED
I know.  And I respect that.  As a 
matter of fact, that’s all I can 
think about... that you turned down 
30 million dollars because you 
cared about something.  You were 
passionate about something.  I want 
to feel that way.  I want to work 
for you.  I don’t know if Gavin 
will give me a good recommendation 
but I’m really fucking good at 
business development.

39
38.
Thomas looks around at his group and smiles. 
THOMAS
It always sounded like bullshit
when every guy with a start up said 
that they wanted “to change the 
world”  Okay, it still sounds like 
bullshit... but maybe we can make 
our mark. 
The crew are swept away.  It is clear that this is what they 
all came out to Silicon Valley for.
ERLICH
AND MAKE SOME MONEY!!!
Big cheers from everyone.  After a beat Thomas turns to Big 
Head and whispers.
THOMAS
We’re going to need some energy 
drinks.
BIG HEAD
Big ones.
And as they all start chattering with excitement about the 
future we...
FADE OUT. *
