COLD OPEN
INT. CLOUD 9 - VARIOUS - DAY (DAY 1)
We’re in a CLOUD 9, a national chain of “big-box” retailers 
selling everything from groceries to electronics to discounted 
designer handbags. Although it’s a giant store, the lighting 
is warm, the decor is inviting. Picture Target, not Walmart.
Under what sounds like narration, we see shots of people 
shopping in some of the different departments.
GARRETT (O.S.)
The American superstore. One-stop 
shopping for everything you could ever 
need or want. Do you want to be thinner? 
IN SPORTING GOODS, a woman jogs on a treadmill that's on 
display on a second shelf.
GARRETT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Fatter?
IN GROCERY, a man lifts a 5-gallon tub of ice cream into his cart.
GARRETT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Happier?
IN TOYS, a cute child jumps excitedly at the range of choices.
GARRETT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Sadder?
IN COSMETICS, a goth teenager paints her lips black.
GARRETT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
It’s a place where you can find conflict...
IN PETS, two dog-owners pushing carts scream at each other to 
move aside. Their dogs are barking at one another as well.
GARRETT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
...and peace...
IN HOME, an elderly couple lies beside one another on one of 
the display mattresses, asleep and snoring.
GARRETT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
...and friendship...
IN ENTERTAINMENT, two dorks in Keanu tee-shirts 
simultaneously grab for the only copy of 47 Ronin on Blu-Ray. 
They get to talking, excited to find a kindred spirit.

INT. CLOUD 9 - JEWELRY COUNTER - CONTINUOUS (DAY 1)
CLOSE-UP: A cheap, low-quality engagement ring.
GARRETT (O.S.)
...and even love.
We reveal AMY (28, attractive and sardonic), wearing the 
cloud-themed vest of an employee, showing the ring to a 19-
year-old cheesy, vain, Justin Bieber-type: BO.
AMY
It’s actually a cubic zirconia knock-off, 
but you can’t tell. And at $10.88, it’s a 
ring that says, “I want to marry you as 
much as two Subway footlongs.”
Bo points to a SIGN: “Engagement Rings: $8.88 - $10.88”.
BO
What about the eight-buck ones?
AMY
Those are sold out. But for two dollars 
more, you get the genuine aluminum 
setting. You may be familiar with 
aluminum as the packaging from some of 
your favorite pop drinks.
BO
Dang, I ain’t the one who’s gotta wear it.
Amy reacts - “what a dick”. Bo thinks a moment, decides.
BO (CONT’D)
Fine. I gotta stand in line for 
cigarettes anyhow.
AMY
Your girlfriend’s a lucky lady. She’ll be 
wearing that for the rest of her life...
He walks off with the ring.
AMY (CONT’D)
...or until she has to pawn it for bail 
money.
She sighs, exhausted, as she takes off her vest, calling off:
AMY (CONT’D)
I’m taking my break!

INT. PERSONAL CARE SECTION - MOMENTS LATER
Amy, holding her vest bunched up in her hands, is walking 
through the store, wearing an expression that says, “It’s 
been a long day and it’s not going to be over any time soon.”
She approaches a large toilet paper display, where someone 
who seems to be a customer (JONAH, 23, dynamic with a boyish 
charm), is reaching for a roll right from the middle.
AMY
Wait, don't--
But she’s too late. The tower of toilet paper collapses on 
top of him. She shakes her head - more work for her to do.
AMY (CONT’D)
Smart. The best rolls are always right in 
the middle.
JONAH
(joking)
That’s what I figured. They’re the load-
bearing ones.
He starts (ineptly) trying to rebuild the display. She 
watches him for a moment, then smiles and relents:
AMY
Need a hand?
JONAH
Nah, I've got it. I work here.
AMY
(confused)
No you don’t.
JONAH
Is it that obvious? It’s my first day, I 
was hoping to blend in. Not seem like the 
over-educated, spoiled New York City guy 
who's never had a job before.
Amy flinches, annoyed at the comment. She decides not to 
reveal that she’s an employee there herself.
AMY
Ohhhhh. You think people will just 
“sense” that you don't belong here.

SUPERSTORE     "PILOT"     Network 3rd Draft     1/14/15     CO/4.
JONAH
You spotted it right away. Is it the 
hands? I’ve always had soft skin, I 
don’t, like, moisturize or anything.
AMY
You just seem so... cultured, compared 
to:
She gestures to a six-months pregnant teenage employee 
(CHEYENNE) working nearby.
JONAH
I’d keep your voice down. That sounds a 
little condescending.
AMY
(deadpan)
It does, doesn’t it?
(then)
So you went to college and now you work 
at Cloud 9. I’m surprised they don’t 
require a PhD.
JONAH
I just think you can’t be successful at 
the top unless you’ve also worked at the 
bottom. And I think it’ll be fun. 
Jonah, intent on getting the toilet paper to balance, doesn’t 
notice how much Amy looks like she wants to attack him.
AMY
Sure, it must be fun to work here. 
Otherwise, how could they get away with 
paying them so little?
JONAH
I just mean it’s an adventure. Seeing a 
different world, different people. Like a 
safari, but with less chance of being 
mauled.
AMY
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Cheyenne, the pregnant girl, walks up to Amy.
CHEYENNE
Hey, can you cover me a sec? This thing 
is kickin’ my bladder like it owes him 
money.

SUPERSTORE     "PILOT"     Network 3rd Draft     1/14/15     CO/5.
JONAH AMY
Sure, it’s just my first day, No problem. Use the one in 
but-- front so Dina won’t dock you.
Jonah gives Amy a shocked look as he realizes she works here. 
CHEYENNE (CONT’D)
Thanks.
Cheyenne runs off. As Amy puts her vest back on:
AMY
Definitely keep your voice down. If any 
employees in the middle of a 16-hour-
shift heard you talking like that, they'd 
probably want to punch you in the face 
right now. Good luck.
She walks off, leaving Jonah at a loss for words. After a 
beat, the toilet paper tower he’s built collapses on him 
again.
GARRETT (O.S.)
The superstore is a melting pot...
CUT TO:
INT. INTERCOM AREA - CONTINUOUS
We reveal that the voice belongs to GARRETT (early 30s): 
charismatic, confident, good-looking, and in a wheelchair. He 
waxes philosophically over the store intercom.
GARRETT
...a place where all types of people from 
all walks of life are free to go after 
what they want. Basically, the superstore 
is America. And in America, is there 
anything we don’t want?

ACT ONE
INT. A DIFFERENT, GENERIC CLOUD 9 - DAY
A manager, played by CHRISTOPHER LLOYD, helps bandage a YOUNG 
EMPLOYEE’S hand.
CHRISTOPHER LLOYD 
When opening boxes, always cut away from 
your body. Remember: “Don’t be hasty when 
it comes to your safety.”
YOUNG EMPLOYEE
I got distracted by a union rep who was 
trying to recruit me.
CHRISTOPHER LLOYD
The union?! Great Scott! The union 
doesn’t care about you. You don’t need to 
be from the future...
(he turns and winks to camera)
...to know that.
WE WIDEN OUT TO:
INT. CLOUD 9 - MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - DAY (DAY 1)
A large back room filled with tables, used for breaks and 
staff meetings. Right now, a number of the employees are 
watching a corporate video. GLENN (50s), the fatherly-but-not-
very-bright Manager, stands at the front beside the monitor.
GLENN
So what can we learn from this?
MATEO (30s), another new hire, wearing a shirt-and-tie, 
stands and reads from his copious notes.
MATEO
I learned that we shouldn’t be hasty when 
it comes to our safety.
GLENN
Very good, that’s exactly right.
DINA (30s), the strong, militant, occasionally frightening 
Assistant Manager.
DINA
What if she cut herself on purpose to get 
disability? I think the lesson is: always 
check the surveillance tapes.

SUPERSTORE     "PILOT"     Network 3rd Draft     1/14/15     I/7.
GARRETT
I also sensed a subtle anti-union message.
ON SCREEN: Christopher Lloyd addresses camera.
CHRISTOPHER LLOYD
Workplace safety begins with YOU. And if 
you or someone you know is considering 
joining a union, call: 1-800-UNION-BAD.
The number chyrons on screen. Glenn turns off the monitor.
GLENN
A few other items. Today is the first day 
of our Back-To-School sale. That means a 
sale on Back-To-School items, not Back To 
School the movie, which is regular price.
As Glenn continues, Jonah leans over to Amy, whispers:
JONAH
Why didn’t you tell me you worked here?
AMY
I thought it was obvious from the dull 
look in my eyes and monosyllabic speech 
patterns.
GLENN
...When handing a customer a receipt, you 
say, “Have a Heavenly Day.” Not, “See you 
in Heaven.”
CHEYENNE
I understand that Glenn, and I explained 
to that lady that I didn’t know she had 
cancer, but judging from the language she 
used, honestly, I don’t think I will be 
seeing her in heaven after all.
JONAH
(still whispering to Amy)
I think you misunderstood what I was 
saying before. I'm not an elitist.
AMY
“Elitist”? What's that?
JONAH
Like someone who thinks they're better 
than--
(realizing)
You know what elitist means.

SUPERSTORE     "PILOT"     Network 3rd Draft     1/14/15     I/8.
AMY
Oh yeah, they learnt that to us back in 
home school.
GLENN
We have two new employees starting today. 
Out of all the applications we received, 
these two were the best and the brightest 
of the ones who passed the urine test. 
Would you like to introduce yourselves?
JONAH
Sure. Hey everyone, I’m Jonah. I’m really 
excited to be working with you.
He gives a little wave. Then Mateo stands.
MATEO
My name is Mateo Hernandez. I grew up 
here in St. Louis. I have eleven brothers 
and sisters, several of which are 
presently incarcerated at this point in 
time for alleged criminalities which I am 
not at liberty to discuss if they are 
guilty. I’ve made some mistakes in my 
life as well, but now I'm here to make 
something of myself, spread my wings, and 
see how far I can fly. Thank you.
There’s a beat as people look back to Jonah. He stands again.
JONAH
I have one brother. Dentist. Married to 
another dentist, actually, so... two-
dentist family.
GARRETT
(sarcastically amazed)
Get out of town!!
Glenn takes out a small black quote book.
GLENN
Now I used to end these meetings with 
some wisdom from the good book, but then 
somebody...
(looking to Dina)
reported me to corporate.
DINA
I’m a Christian too, but within these 
walls, my god is the Employee Code of 
Conduct.

SUPERSTORE     "PILOT"     Network 3rd Draft     1/14/15     I/9.
GLENN
And we all thank you for it. So in honor 
of your first day at Cloud 9, we’ll turn 
to the secular for inspiration:
(leafs through book, muttering)
Let’s see: clouds, clouds... ah!
(reads)
“There will always be some uncertainty 
about how quickly Saddam can acquire 
nuclear weapons. But we don’t want the 
smoking gun to be a mushroom... cloud.”
He closes the book meaningfully. Then, with all the grandeur 
of Richard Attenborough introducing Jurassic Park:
GLENN (CONT’D)
Welcome. Welcome to Cloud 9!
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. CLOUD 9 - PATIO SECTION - DAY
SFX: The theme from Jurassic Park, faint and tinny, piped in 
over the store speakers.
But instead of brachiosauruses, we cut to a group of 
extremely elderly shoppers, slowly driving their motorized 
shopping carts, herd-like, across the Patio section.
CUT TO:
INT. BABY AISLE - LATER
A LOST CUSTOMER walks up to Jonah.
LOST CUSTOMER
Excuse me? Which aisle is Books in?
JONAH
I have no idea. Which aisle is Home 
Appliances in?
LOST CUSTOMER
(confused)
Um... I think that’s aisle twelve.
JONAH
Twelve? That’s this way? Great, thanks.
He walks on. Garrett, holding a couple boxes on his lap, 
wheels up alongside Jonah, having witnessed the interaction.
GARRETT
If a customer asks you something you 
don’t know, make it up.

11
SUPERSTORE     "PILOT"     Network 3rd Draft     1/14/15     I/10.
JONAH
What if I send him to the wrong place?
GARRETT
When customers look at us, all they see 
is a blue vest. So they never complain 
because they’re never sure who they were 
talking to. It's like a racism that works 
out really well for us. I’m Garrett.
JONAH
(shaking his hand)
Jonah. Don’t we get some kind of 
training? I’ve just been walking from one 
department to another so it looks like I 
have a purpose.
GARRETT
It works better if you carry a box around.
He tosses him one of his boxes, which is obviously empty.
GARRETT (CONT’D)
See? You’ll learn as you go. Just be here 
on time, don’t steal, and stay on the 
floor supervisor’s good side.
JONAH
Who’s the floor supervisor?
Garrett points across the store to... Amy. Jonah’s face falls.
CUT TO:
INT. SEASONAL ITEMS - MOMENTS LATER
The section is set up for the Back-To-School sale. Amy is 
scanning items with a PDA. Jonah walks up, pointing to his vest.
JONAH
I never thought of myself as a “vest guy”, 
but now I think I might be a vest guy.
(she smiles a little)
I didn’t mean to offend you earlier.
AMY
It’s fine. I think hearing the job I’ve had 
for ten years described as a “fun 
adventure” just rubbed me the wrong way.
JONAH
Can we start over? I’m Jonah. And you are:
(reading her name tag)
“Georgiana?”

12
SUPERSTORE     "PILOT"     Network 3rd Draft     1/14/15     I/11.
AMY
Oh, that’s not mine. I just don't like 
random strangers using my name as if 
we're buddies. Like how hookers don't 
kiss on the lips. 
JONAH
So what’s your real name?
AMY
(considers him, then)
We can start over, we’re not friends yet. 
(re: Back-To-School items)
Okay, this stuff is supposed to be 25 
percent off, but the POS system is down 
so we need to discount it all manually. 
So scan each barcode...
(she scans an item)
then hit “Enter”, “Reassign”, “Override”, 
code “96315”, “Enter”, “Reduce”, 25 
percent so “Point-two-five”, “Enter”, 
“Confirm”. Got that?
He stares at her blankly.
AMY (CONT’D)
And they say college doesn’t prepare you 
for the real world.
JONAH
It did in some ways. This job requires a 
comprehensive knowledge of the plays of 
Henrik Ibsen, right?
She laughs.
JONAH (CONT’D)
That’s my point. My dad wanted me to come 
work at his firm after I graduated, but I 
don’t want to be some sheltered corporate 
drone with no experience in the real world.
AMY
I guess I can, weirdly, respect that.
JONAH
Plus, I’ve been in school my entire life. 
It’ll be nice to have a break from using 
my brain for a while.
(realizing how bad that sounds)
I didn’t mean-- Can we start over again?
But before she can respond, Amy spots Bo, the kid she sold the 
ring to earlier, approaching Cheyenne and getting down on one 
knee. She shoves the PDA into Jonah’s hands.

13
SUPERSTORE     "PILOT"     Network 3rd Draft     1/14/15     I/12.

CUT TO:
INT. CASH REGISTER - CONTINUOUS
Amy speedwalks over to where Bo is proposing. An ELDERLY LADY 
catches up to her, holding several bottles of pills.
ELDERLY LADY
Excuse me, miss, what’s the difference 
between a stool softener and a laxative?
AMY
Be right with you. Cheyenne, what’s going on?
CHEYENNE
My boyfriend asked me to marry him!
BO
Babe, I told you not to call me your 
boyfriend. We're just having fun.
ELDERLY LADY
I don’t want it soft, I want it out of me.
AMY
I didn't realize before that Cheyenne was 
the lucky girl you'd be proposing to.
BO
Yeah, well, I knocked her up. So my dad 
said I had to.
CHEYENNE
Aaaahhhh!!!
AMY
I know, so romantic!
ELDERLY LADY
(reading bottle)
“Bulking agent”. That sounds like just 
about the last thing I need.
AMY
You didn’t say yes, did you?
CHEYENNE
Why shouldn’t I say yes?

14
SUPERSTORE     "PILOT"     Network 3rd Draft     1/14/15     I/13.
Cheyenne gives her a wary look, like, “What are you implying 
about Bo?” Amy takes her aside and talks to her quietly.
AMY
Look, I know it’s easy to get swept up 
in...
(looks around at surroundings)
...the romance of the moment. But try to 
be a little practical and think this 
through. Don’t do something you’ll regret 
for the rest of your life.
The elderly lady, hearing this, takes it to heart as she 
considers her pill options.
ELDERLY LADY
Yeah, okay, I’ll sleep on it.
CUT TO:
INT. SEASONAL ITEMS / RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
Jonah looks across the store at Amy. He holds up the PDA 
triumphantly and waves.
JONAH
I figured it out!
In the store’s FAST FOOD RESTAURANT behind her, Dina is on a 
break, eating a slice of pizza. She looks up from her Guns & 
Ammo to see Jonah smiling and waving. She checks behind her - 
there’s no one there - and concludes he must be waving at her. 
She wipes the grease off her mouth and bashfully waves back.
Mateo, pushing a cart nearby, sees Jonah smiling proudly.
JONAH (CONT’D)
Big victory for me.
MATEO
No offense, but it’s a dog-eat-dog world 
and you’re my competition. So I take no 
joy in your accomplishments. In all 
honesty, I root for your failures.
Jonah reacts as Mateo moves on.

As Amy walks through the store, she notices several customers

MATEO
Think of me as your protégé. I want to 
learn everything you know about business.
GLENN
I’d be honored. Let’s see what we have 
here: business, business, business...
He leafs through his quote book as Amy approaches.
AMY
Glenn, why is there suddenly a run on 
Back-To-School items?
GLENN
Must be those commercials.
(a la Christopher Lloyd)
Great Scott, Marty, you’ve got to go 
back! Back to School!
But Amy’s unsure. She glances towards where Jonah is 
repricing items, and customers are frantically grabbing them 
off the shelves, as she starts to wonder what’s going on...

Yep. Scan, Enter, Reassign, Override, 
96315, Enter, Reprice, Point-two-five--
AMY
Reduce.
JONAH
Huh?
AMY
Reduce point-two-five. Reprice point-two-
five would change the price to 25 cents.
They look around at the frenzy of customers grabbing items 
off the shelves.

I’ll try to guess--
Amy turns and sprints off to the front.

No, what I’m saying is, these [continuous string of a

CHRISTOPHER LLOYD
Your one little mistake could have a 
ripple effect on the whole future!
(looks to camera)
Always be precise, whether you’re selling 
sticks of chewing gum or flux capacitors.
GARRETT
I don’t understand why he doesn’t travel 
back in time and warn her about these 
things before-hand. I think he just likes 
being the “I told you so” guy.
Jonah looks at Glenn, who stands beside the monitor.
JONAH
Do you really need to make everyone watch 
this? I’m the one who--
GLENN
Bup bup bup! There’s no need to embarrass 
whoever it is whose fault this was. 
Besides, we can all learn a lesson here.
MATEO
Would that lesson be not letting Jonah 
reprice inventory in the future?
GLENN
It might be, yes.
Jonah shakes his head in humiliation. He looks around the 
room, finally making eye contact with Amy. She shakes her 
head with a little smile that makes Jonah feel better.
Then Jonah leans over to Garrett, who is sitting beside him, 
eating from a bag of microwave popcorn as if they’re watching 
a real movie and not a corporate video. He whispers:
JONAH
What’s the deal with dating between staff

Glenn sits at a table in the restaurant, working on a jigsaw

fit. Cheyenne takes a seat across from him.
CHEYENNE
Glenn, you’ve been married a long time.
GLENN
Thirty-five wonderful years.
He shows her the puzzle - a hodgepodge of disjointed jigsaw 
pieces that shouldn’t be together.
GLENN (CONT’D)
Paris. Weird city.

Do you ever regret it?

The tired, pasty employee who we saw earlier (picture a human 
Droopy Dog) slowly stocks items on a shelf. On the other side

Jonah is stocking cans, although we don’t yet reveal how he’s

GARRETT
It’s close to work. You’d have your own 
bedroom. Plus, wide hallways, nice ramps, 
and have you ever seen a wheelchair-
accessible shower? It’s like a palace.
Jonah contemplates it. Then he notices Amy approaching and 
calls out to her:
JONAH
Hey. What do you think?
He points to the shelves, and we reveal that rather than 
stock the cans in order, he's created an impressive -- and 
attractive -- mural of Amy’s face.
AMY
I think that no one’s going to be able to 
find what they’re looking for. Plus, in 
the time it took you to do this, you 
could have stocked five times as much, so 
it’s made more work for the rest of us.

JONAH
I was just having a little fun--
AMY
I know this is a “life experience” for 
you, but most of us are here because they 
give us a paycheck. Then we cash that 
paycheck for money, and we use that money 
for extravagances like food and rent.
JONAH
I was an econ major, we covered a lot of 
this.
AMY
This doesn’t need to be fun. If it were, 
they wouldn’t have to pay us to do it. So 
let’s just be practical and do our jobs so 
we can go home and enjoy our lives, okay?
JONAH
I get that we have a job to do, I’m not 
naive. But does that mean we can’t ever, I 
don’t know, find moments of beauty in it?
AMY
“Moments of beauty”? Are you really that 
cheesy?
JONAH
Or fun or joy or... okay, yeah, it sounds 
cheesy, but: beauty. Like... remember in 
that movie?

As they’re passing the check-out aisle, Jonah grabs a plastic 
bag from a bagger and tosses it up into the air, hoping for 
an American Beauty-like transcendent moment.
They all watch as the bag drifts down to the floor, bit by 
bit, in a totally mundane, non-transcendent way.
Beat. The bagger slowly picks up the bag and starts putting 
items in it again. Jonah looks embarrassed.

That just blew my mind right there.
Jonah walks quickly out the front doors. As Amy follows:

I want you to gather up all the shopping

Don't they have people for that?
AMY
They do. You're one of them. Be careful 
about touching the metal - on a day like 
this, it's heated up like a steam iron. 
And you'll need to fight the occasional 
homeless man for possession.

Seriously, I’ve started to dream I’m

I can’t do it. You’ll have to find

Slow down, you’ve had more experience

Your disability is not my concern.

HEY! The only thing I asked you to do was 
put away the carts.
Jonah and Garrett look up at her, caught.

Which is what I’m doing. Just, in a

AMY
Your band-aid’s falling off.
JONAH
Cloud 9 brand. Not the best adhesive.
We see a shot of the floor by his feet, where a bunch of low-
quality bandages have fallen off in a heap.
AMY
I’m sorry. I’ve been having kind of a 
long day. Ten years of long days, 
actually.
He doesn’t respond. Amy picks up one of the items he’s 
stocking - a giant box of glow-in-the-dark stars.
AMY (CONT’D)
I stock these glow stars every year for the 
Back-To-School sale. And then I take them 
down and put up the Halloween inventory. 
And then Thanksgiving, Christmas, 
Valentine's Day, President's Day Sale, 
Easter, St. Patrick's Day, Mother’s Day, 
Father’s Day, Graduation, Summer, Fourth of 
July, and then Back-To-School again.
JONAH
That sounds incredibly practical and 
dull. I see why you love it here.
AMY
Look, it’s a good job, okay? But tomorrow 
is going to be the same as today. And I 
know that because today is the same as 
yesterday. So sometimes, it's just tough 
to find those “moments of beauty.”

You were working? Where? Cause I’ve been

STARES quietly -- looking up in childlike wonder. 
Finally, Amy rips her gaze from the ceiling and turns to 
Jonah, who isn’t watching the stars, he’s watching her. He
