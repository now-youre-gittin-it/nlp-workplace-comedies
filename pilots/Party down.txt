INT. BATHROOM
THE HANDSOME FACE of Kyle Bradway (23) faces itself in a
mirror. Hands fluff the hair to casual unkempt perfection.
KYLE
(dramatic, cocky)
You re in the Palisades, now...
(liking it)
You re in the Palisades, now...
He consults the SCRIPT in his hand.
KYLE ( CONT' D)
homes. You re in the...
INT. COFFEE HOUSE
A LAPTOP SCREEN. Page one of a SCREENPLAY. Fingers type a
character name - " Sargon
ROMAN DE BEERS (31) - sour, indistinct - thinks. Backspaces.
Retypes - "Slargon " Considers this. Then more backspacing.
WIDER SHOT - the place is full of wannabe screenwriters
pecking at laptops. Roman is the oldest guy there.
RON (V.
The question isn t how do I achieve
success? It' s, what is success?
INT. HALL
AT A LECTERN, RON DONALD (36) addresses an unseen audience.
RON
I was recently made team leader, so
I have to ask myself. Is success
pleasing my client? My team? Me?
It' s complex! So I' ve learned that
success isn t just about success.
It' s also about... balancing.
THE AUDIENCE is a group of men of varying ages. A MAN nods as
Ron sits, pleased, shuffling his notes.
MAN
Thank you, Ron. Who s next?
A GAUNT MAN stands.
GAUNT MAN
Hi. My name is Troy, and I' m and
m an alcoholic.

3
MAN' S VOICE (0. S. 
Goddamrnit, that is such bullshit!
INT. STUDIO CITY APARTMENT
CASEY KLEIN (32) - smartly attractive, very stressed - rushes
through the apartment, gathering things as a MAN' S VOICE
explodes from the bedroom offscreen. A furious argument.
MAN' S VO I CE (0 . S . )
It' s like talking to a goddamn
wall, you don t even try to listen--
CASEY
(grabbing car keys)
I am listening. I just have to go--
She makes for the door like it' s a life-raft.
MAN' S VOICE
You don t have to go anywhere!
What you have to do is stay and--
THE DOOR slams behind her.
INT. SMALL APARTMENT
THREE AFGHAN HOUNDS blunder around a small apartment
cluttered with candles and flaky Hollywood decor.
CONSTANCE (40' s) - a vaguely new-agey woman in a tuxedo shirt
and tie - tidies a knocked-over stack of four-picture
headshots. Constance as various saucy characters.
CONSTANCE
. . . and don t chew these! They
very important for mommy s work.
(to one of the dogs)
Millie, be nice to your sister.
And if my manager calls, the
answer is yes! Home for bedtime.
She heads out the door, making kiss-noises to the dogs.
INT. 1995 BMW - MOVING - DAY
A. traffic - a hazy sea of brake-lights. In a tired, dented
95 BMW sits HENRY POLLARD (33). He wears an old tux shirt
and bow tie below a handsome face starting to go to seed. On
the radio, a test of the emergency broadcast system starts
droning. Henry stares, reaches for the dial , and turns it up.

4
EXT. THOUSAND OAKS DRIVEWAY - DAY
Suburban Thousand Oaks. A van with a corporate logo sits in a
drive. "Party Down! Everything For Your Entertaining Needs
RON DONALD -- in tux shirt and tie and clipboard -- addresses
Kyle, Roman, and Constance , in cater-waiter uniforms. Bored.
RON
People, focus here, please? Kyle,
what did I just say?
Kyle doesn t know.
ROMAN
We get a thirty-cent-an-hour raise
if we do the sensitivity seminar.
RON
which I recommend. I' ve taken it
twice, and I learned a lot.
KYLE
You took it twice?
ROMAN
He had to. The Hirsh-Wong Bar
Mitzvah -- remember?
CONSTANCE
(laughs at memory; with
horrible, racist accent)
Me so hungry!"
Ron laughs too... it was funny, right?
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
Henry parks. Sighs fatalistically at sight of the van. Climbs
out, wincing. His back. That dent has a story behind it.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
Ron consults his clipboard again.
. . . so let' RON
s make this the best Oak
Terrace homeowners ' association
annual potluck ever, okay?
(smiling to them)
And. . . our hostess has allowed us to
put out the jar tonight.

5
Groans from Roman, Constance and Kyle.
RON (CONT'
I know what you re going to say...
ROMAN
Oh, man.. . what about just taking
the guaranteed twenty bucks?
RON
What about, it' s a life lesson? Bet
on ourselves, work hard, and win?
(spotting something)
But let' s ask our new team member.
(as Henry approaches)
Henry. The jar, right?
HENRY
The wha t ?
RON
The tip jar. That' s how we did it,
back in the day?
HENRY
Yeah.. ?
RON
See? It' s decided!
(the crew is pissed)
Henry Pollard. We crewed together
before he left to be a big star.
(to Henry)
Welcome back. Pollard and Donald,
together again! Yeah.
Ron grins, offers a "high five. " Henry isn t in the mood, but
Ron s grin and hand stay there until he gives a limp " five.
RON (CONT'
Back in the day, he was on time.
(checking watch)
Speaking of which, that' s a demerit
for Ms. Klein. Again.
(back to the clipboard)
So. Our hostess wants a fun but
responsible affair. That means
brisk service and one modest jigger
for all cocktails. No doubles. And,
as always, of course..
(when no one jumps in)
Smiles

6
He points to his smile as he " smiles " professionally. Only
Constance copies him. Then, with too much gravity...
RON (CONT'
Let' s roll.
AROUND THE TRUCK
The crew unloads the van. Henry - not even wanting to start,
watches KYLE muttering lines to himself as he loads glasses.
RON ( 0 . C . ) (CONT'
Hey, Pollard!
Ron motions from the van. Henry smiles slyly. Heads over.
HENRY
, the old pre-party ritual.
(mimes doing a shot)
The one thing I was actually
looking forward to. You remember
when we drank that whole...
RON
Ha! Yeah --
(serious)
No. It' s... they told you about the
shirt, right?
HENRY
Umm, what? A white shirt, right?
RON
crisp, white shirt.
(over-j okey)
I mean, did you sleep in that
thing? In a forest??
(before he can answer)
Don t beat yourself up. Here. 
never leave home without a backup.
Ron hands him a plastic-wrapped shirt. Henry stares a beat.
HENRY
Wow, Ron, you run a pretty tight
ship. I never would' ve imagined, I
mean. . . back in the day, you...
RON
(cutting him off)
A lot can happen in eight years.

7
. . ...
HENRY
Yeah. I know.
MUSICAL JINGLE (V. o. )
I Love the Nineties...
INT. KITCHEN
MONICA - Liddy s generically "hot" 16-year-old daughter -
leans on the counter , watching a small TV. Montage images of
Grunge Music, Monica Lewinsky, Cargo pants, etc.
KYLE arranges mushroom caps beside CONSTANCE. LIDDY, our
hostess, nervously smooths her too-dressy outfit.
. . . the " CONSTANCE
Poseidon Adventure?" You
remember, when the boat flips, the
chandelier lands on a girl? That
was me. And you know what Gene
said? "Kid, you ve got a natural
talent for being crushed.
(Can you believe it?)
Gene Hackman!
KYLE
He was awesome in Batman.
(spots HENRY in the hall)
Think he s someone? That guy?
CONSTANCE
re all someone, Kyle.
(then. . .
But, yeah, I know what you mean, I
feel like I know him. 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Henry pulls on Ron s "back- " shirt. It' s ridiculous -
billowy and large. A glum beat as he considers himself in the
mirror -- this is his life now. He takes out a pill bottle.
Pops a vicodin -- does Roy Scheider in All That Jazz
HENRY
Show time.
INT. KITCHEN
ROMAN enters through the back door with a box of CD'
KYLE
Hey, man, you gonna play my demo?

8
-- 
ROMAN
Yeah, wanna grab it? It' s in the
truck in a box marked " shit rock.
Roman smirks at Monica. Showed him, huh? She recoils, wants
nothing to do with Roman. Kyle laughs, good-naturedly...
KYLE
Right, " shit rock!"
MONICA
Are you in a band?
Roman grimaces as Monica makes doe-eyes at Kyle.
EXT. PATIO
Ron stocks a portable bar as Roman sets up DJ gear. CASEY
KLEIN bustles in on her phone. In a sweatshirt her tux
shirt is in her hand. Ron glares, but she doesn t care.
. . . I CASEY (ON PHONE)
had Groundlings. I can t now,
because my boss is staring right at
me angrily. No, Mike.
(hangs up, facing Ron)
Wha t?
RON
You know what that is, right?
CASEY
(stares at phone, puzzled)
Actually, no. What is this thing?
RON
I mean, it' s an R. D. D.
CASEY
Right. A Ron Donald Do.
(off his look)
A don t? I get them confused.
RON
Personal business on company time.
A "Ron Donald Don
She glances around... then pulls off her sweatshirt - just a
bra underneath. Roman double-takes. Stares longingly.
RON (CO NT' D)
I know you know this, but--

9
Ron turns. Shocked to see her in her bra. He gawks.
CASEY
(pulling on the shirt)
That' s harrassment, Ron. Stop
harrassing me or I' ll file a card.
RON
(turns away)
No, I... I didn t mean it.
(turns away, continuing)
But the point isn t to know it'
to remember. Cause you re on thin
ice with the RDD' s.
Casey, ignoring Ron, checks herself in the window. A frazzled
sigh. Henry approaches, looking absurd in the giant shirt.
RON (CONT'
That' s more like it.
(to Casey)
This is Henry. Our new team member.
Henry and Casey exchange a smile. A little spark.
CASEY
Casey.
(smirking at the shirt)
Nice. Going for your own look.
HENRY
Thought I' d try a gay pirate kind
0 f thing.
RON
Actually, no, this I learned in
sensitivity seminar, we don t use
that word. I mean, I' m not, but you
never know who might be, you know--
CASEY
A pirate?
RON
I meant more.. . gays. Liddy!
LIDDY has appeared behind him. Pre-party jitters.
LIDDY
I just want to be sure we--

10
RON
m sure you will be the hostess
with the mostest and this will be
the best-est annual potluck ever.
LIDDY
And we ll be getting video--?
Casey gives a thumbs up. Pointing the camera at her.
LIDDY (CONT'
Good. . . Is that on?
CASEY (0. S.
Yes. And you re a star.
VIDEO-CAM POV - We see Liddy frozen on camera - awkward.
Constance sees, and steps into frame, bursting with " fun.
CONSTANCE
(playing to camera)
Who s the hostess with the mostest?
Being "helpful, " she takes Liddy s arm and moves it in rhythm
with her own turning the two of them into a paddle wheel.
CONSTANCE (CONT'
singing)
Big wheel keep on turning. Proud
Mary keep on burning.
Constance gives a big "Showtime" smile. Ron claps along.
RON
Oh, boy! Look at that! That' s fun.
CASEY CAM POV - Liddy might implode from self-conciousness.
INT. LIVING ROOM - BAR - DAY
A big " Sears portrait studio style photo of Liddy and her
family hangs on the wall. Big smiles. Beneath it...
HENRY slices limes with glum disinterest. Looks up to find
Ron observing with concern. A beat. . 
RON
You re rusty. That' s cool. It'
come back to you.
Huh? A beat, as Ron motions for Henry to hand him the knife.

11
10.
RON (CONT'
Watch the old pro, here.
Henry, annoyed but covering, hands over the knife, making
space as Ron steps in and lifts a lime to the light.
RON (CONT'
See that?
Henry looks at the lime. He sees nothing.
HENRY
A lime.
RON
The grain.
HENRY
Grain?
RON
You see it now?
HENRY
A lime doesn t have a grain , Ron.
Ron gives a patronizing chuckle.
RON
m sorry. It' s just...
(doing a character, not a
Star Wars character , just
an odd voice)
You have much to learn young Jedi.
(normal voice)
Watch this.
Ron " shows off" by overtly locking eyes with Henry as he
masterfully slices a lime without looking.
RON (CONT'
A lime s grain runs north/south.
Nipple to nipple. The way you were
cutting it, lopping it across the
stern? That' s how minimum wage kids
working graveyard at Chucky Cheese
do it. You end up with this...
CASEY CAM P. O. V. - INTERCUT - as Ron picks up one of Henry
early attempts. Holds it out.
RON (CONT'
Wedges.

12
11.
Ron then begins to demonstrate his way, cutting the lime
vertically, then slicing each half vertically four times.
Henry looks up, sees they re being video-taped by Casey. He
gives her an " m in hell" look. She smirks, keeps filming.
HENRY
Should I get a pen?
RON
You ll get it. Just watch me now.
What we want are slices. Eight.
Long. Lean. Slices.
(holding one up)
Now that' ll look good hanging off
the rim of a G&T, rum and coke,
what have you. You know what helps
me remember stuff?
HENRY
Mnemonics?
RON
(surprised, impressed)
Yeah! You, too?
HENRY
No, just... I heard about it.
RON
So. . . what would be a mnemonic way
of remembering this...
(pausing to think)
Slices. . . is nices--
HENRY
That works.
RON
And wedges.. .
HENRY
Are not nices...
RON
They re supposed to rhyme.
(thinking)
Wedges. . . wedges. . .
The two men are stumped for a beat -- Ron wracking his brain;
Henry pretending to wrack his own... until finally

13
12.
RON (CONT'
Wedges get thrown in hedges!
HENRY
I was gonna say push wedges off
ledges. What should we go with?
CASEY
Hedges.
HENRY
Slices is nices. Wedges get thrown
in hedges. Think I got it now.
CASEY
Does that work with lemons?
RON
Totally different animal.
(noticing her camera)
How ' bout you save that video tape
for the party guests, huh, Casey?
CASEY
(totally deadpan)
Actually, they want us to film some
of this instructional stuff because
a lot of the younger generation
employees don t read anymore.
Ron ponders that notion for a beat, decides it' s a good idea.
RON
(to camera, holds up lime)
Okay. So remember, slices...
CASEY
No, I got that.
RON
Oh. Should I do napkin fanning?
Just then, Casey s cellphone rings. Ron glares at her.
RON (CONT'
What ice are you on?
(off her puzzled reaction)
Thin. Thin ice.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Kyle struggles with jar of sauce. The lid pops, and sauce
splats on LIDDY' S dress. Kyle stares dumbly as Ron swoops in.

14
13.
RON
No, no, don t touch.
He takes a Shout Stick from his pocket and attacks her stain.
LIDDY
Mr. Darnell. You are efficient.
RON
(laughing too hard)
Listen to that. You ve got your
client feedback card half-written.
CAROL AYAAM (O.
Who likes lasagna!
Some guests have arrived with pot-luck dishes. They react to
the waiters - Liddy has taken the event to the "next level.
LIDDY
Ron, why don t you take that.
(to her, aren t I fancy?)
This is our catering team captain.
CAROL AYAAM
Catering captain? Oooh...
AHMED AYAAM
(offering hand)
Hi. Ahmed Ayaam.
CAROL AYAAM
Carol Ayaam.
Ron , drunk on sensitivity training, thinks he s hit a custom
he hasn t been trained for. He panics, then offers a hand:
RON
Ron. .. I am.
(off the extreme awkward
silence)
m not really a captain.
(knowing he s screwed up,
but unsure how)
ll need another year of service.
You can tell a captain, because a
captain wears a silver bowtie.
Still the awkward silence.

15
. .
14.
EXT. PATIO
Casey wanders the patio, blankly shooting video of the party
as it gets underway.
-ROMAN tweaks a knob on the music console as " fun" pop music
wafts around the patio. He sourly watches. 
-KYLE , handsome, hair catching the sun, circulating hors
d' ouevres. Monica pointedly stops him and takes one.
-KIDS romp around the pool. Mothers watch, smile, wave.
CONSTANCE , with her tray, watches, smiles, and waves, too.
-ADULTS chat as they sip drinks. Banal suburban patio party.
A man and woman sip wine, watching the waiters circulate.
WOMAN
. . . I mean, what, like last year
thing wasn t good enough because I
didn t have waiters? When did Liddy
become lady fucking Dian...
They then notice the camera. SMILE.
INT. LIVING ROOM - BAR AREA
HENRY mans his bar , watching the kids. Sneaks a drink as
Regular Guy" GORDON WING (30' s) steps up, reacts to the bar.
GORDON
Wow, a bar.
HENRY
And a bartender.
GORDON
High class. Beer me.
Henry hands him a beer. As Gordon leaves, Roman approaches,
sneering at him from head to toe.
ROMAN
Jesus. Ordinary fucking people.
Roman doesn t see Gordon glancing back. He heard the comment.
ROMAN (CONT' D)
Henry, right?
(re: Gordon)
Sweet pleated shorts, dude. Right?
(off Henry s bland shrug)
(MORE)

16
15.
ROMAN ( CONT' D)
I mean, how s business at the ski-
do lot? How is it going back to
your tract home and a frozen dinner
with your fat wife and fat kids
watching "Dancing with the Stars
until you get cancer and die?
HENRY
Probably nice to own a house.
ROMAN

HENRY

ROMAN

HENRY
Repo Man.
ROMAN

Kyle arrives with an empty tray.
KYLE

Get what?
ROMAN
(testing again)

KYLE

ROMAN

ROMAN

ROMAN
Why do you keep saying that?
KYLE

They loved me, I' m going to network
I know it.
(in character)
You re in the Palisades now...
ROMAN
You know what Palisades means in
Spanish? "Boy hooker.
Kyle looks at Henry. Really? Henry gives a quick head shake.
KYLE
Don t be pissed cause I knew your
little trivia, bro...
ROMAN
(totally affronted)
You didn
Ron motors by - scolding mode.
RON
Roman! What am I not hearing?
ROMAN
I don t know. A squid?
RON
Music! Chop chop!
Roman sneers, heads to the music station. A woman approaches.
HEIDI-JANE (41) is pretty, once prettier. Now bored.

18
17.
HEIDI-JANE
Whi te wine. Actually, you know
what, I' ll take a gin and tonic.
(as Henry reaches...
Could you make it a double? I think
I' 11 need it to endure.
(gives a flirty look)
You look very familiar.
KYLE
That' s what I thought.
HENRY
I have that kind of face.
HEIDI-JANE
That kind of cute face.
(taking drink)

She leaves with a flirty look back.
KYLE
Sweet MILF action. Hey, " If music

(off Henry s puzzled look)

HENRY

KYLE
Yeah. And you heard of Karma
Rocket? My band. Lead singer. And I
did some modeling, you know...
HENRY
So you re like in the overall
handsome business. That' s awesome.
KYLE
Yeah, but acting s my passion. You
need passion to deal, you know, cuz
it' s brutal. I been here seven
months, and this is only my fourth
pilot callback. It' s brutal.
(back to Henry)
You an actor? Ron said you were
star of something. Like of what?
HENRY
Nothing. I did some stuff, but--

19
18.
KYLE
Who s your agent?
HENRY
State Farm.
KYLE
Are they good?
(Henry shakes his head)
You get any good auditions?
HENRY
Well. . . I don t really act anymore.
KYLE
(puzzled)
So what are you doing?
HENRY
This.
(beat)
Bartending.
KYLE
Cool. Where?
HENRY
Here.
A long beat as Kyle tries to wrap his head around this idea.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - SUNSET
Henry grabs a case of tonic water off the van. A back
twinge. Ow. He sits, pulls out a cigarette. Glumly smokes.
Casey appears. Henry smiles but she s on the phone:
CASEY
. . . what (on phone, stressed)
would I do in Burlington
stand-up comedy traffic school?
Until you know, what' s to discuss?
Look, I gotta go, you know I can
talk at work. Don t. Mike, do you
hear me? Do not come here...
She hangs up. Takes out a cigarette , and searches for her
lighter. Spots Henry, who holds up his lighter.
HENRY
(as she leans in)
Boyfriend trouble?

20
. .
19.
CASEY
Husband trouble.
Henry registers... husband? Bummer. Casey lights.
CASEY (CONT'
Thanks. . . sorry, I forgot your name.
HENRY
That' s strange. People rarely
forget my name.
CASEY
Why s that?
HENRY
It' s Scrotum Phillips. Two M' s. . .
CASEY
(laughs)
Right. So how s the first day?
(off Henry s look)
Oh, man, right. You worked here. 
HENRY
Eight years ago.
CASEY
So you worked with Ron? Was he
always like this? What was he like?
HENRY
Different. But I' d rather not
think about the fact that--
CASEY
Yeah, you re back. You an actor?
HENRY
What, I look familiar?
CASEY
You re smoking Parliments.
Henry gives a rueful smile, flicks the cigarette away.
CASEY (CONT'
Well , Scrotum, could have been
worse. You could' ve never left.
LIDDY (V.
And the winner is... I' m so excited!

21
20.
EXT. PATIO - SUNSET
An award ceremony is underway on the patio.
Liddy and her HUSBAND stand at a table. Several small plastic
Os cars " are laid out. Casey films with the video camera.
LIDDY
(very " aware" of camera)
And the awardie for "best Christmas
Decorations " goes to...
(consul ting clipboard)
. . . The Weissmans!
CASEY CAM POV - Cheers as MRS. WEISSMAN takes her " awardie.
Crowd reactions. Cheers. Head shaking. CONSTANCE, more
thrilled than anyone, clapping excitedly.
IRATE HUSBAND
We lost. To Jews.
LIDDY
And the awardie for "best yard,
goes to.. . the Wings!
GORDON WING watches blankly as his wife takes the award.
INT. KITCHEN - DURING AWARDS
Roman places a call. Leaves a message in a fake voice.
ROMAN
Yeah, Kyle, this is Jim Tower from
The Palisades. " We loved your
audition, but we looking for a
rougher take on the character. Can
you to come back in tomorrow. . 
Casey enters. She doesn t trust Roman s shit-eating grin.
INT. LIVING ROOM
GORDON enters, passing Liddy, in hostess mode.
LIDDY
Having a good time?
GORDON
(tipsy)
I might. If it weren t for all
these Ordinary Fucking People...
HENRY glumly stares at the family portrait behind him.

22
... . .
21.
GORDON (0. S. ) (CONT'
And the Oscar goes to...
Henry turns. Gordon plops the "oscar" on the bar.
GORDON (CONT' D)
You. Scotch and soda. No soda.
Henry makes the drink, and Gordon stomps away.
Henry stares at the "oscar" on the bar. He makes a drink for
himself. A serious drink. He drinks... nakedly unhappy. 
CASEY CAM POV - we see Henry drinking, unaware.
CASEY (0. S.
That, I believe, is a Ron Donald
Don
CASEY is filming him from the sliding glass door.
HENRY
Actually you might want to get this
for your educational video series.
(announcer-voice)
Now that you can cut limes, let'
learn to drink on the job.
Henry places a cup on the bar.
HENRY (CONT' D)
First, look around. Do you see your
boss? If the answer is no, it'
time to drink. Okay. A drink ought
to be cool, so...
(adds ice, to camera)
Ices is nices. Remember that.
(back to work)
Now, many drinks use a "mixer
. . . but (holding up tonic bottle)
when you re drinking on the
job, a mixer is wasted energy.
(drops mixer, pours vodka)
Remember. "Vodka is nices.
(taking a lime slice)
Frui t garnish? No.
CASEY
You know your material.
HENRY
That' s just the drink. Preparation
of the drinker is more complicated.
(MORE)

23
22.
HENRY (CONT' D)
(to camera)
First. Devote yourself to a dream
and spend ten years neglecting
every other aspect of your life in
pursuit of success. Then, fail.
(looks at drink)
When your girlfriend gets tired of
your fatalism and leaves, celebrate
with a car accident. Realize you
actor s guild insurance expired and
you need a job, but don t move back
to Milwaukie. Your old friends
have jobs and homes and families
and normal lives and you still wear
Sketchers. " That' s embarrassing.
So why not go back to your old job
and avoid the subj ect . Have you
done that?
(holding up the drink)
Now, you re ready to drink.
He drains the drink on a single swallow.
INT. MONICA' S BEDROOM
CLOSE ON MONICA - face pained:
MONICA
God, I hate this. Same boring
walls, same boring people, year
after year. I feel just like her.
KYLE nods, caught up.
KYLE
Yeah.
MONICA
Trapped.
KYLE
Totally
MONICA
Knowing there s a whole world out
there, and you re not part of it.
KYLE
Wanting to express herself but not
knowing how.
MONICA
Right!

24
23.
KYLE
No eyes, no ears.
Monica glances at the play in her lap. "Diary of Anne Frank.
MONICA
Anne Frank had eyes.
KYLE
(wise)
But could they see?
MONICA
Yeah...
KYLE
Oh. I was thinking Helen Keller.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Back with Casey and Henry. Shar ing a dr ink.
HENRY
How long you been married?
CASEY
143 years.
HENRY
Kids?
CASEY
No. But he wants the whole bit.
House, kids, yard, him raking
leaves, me holding two cups of hot
chocolate, everyone wearing the
reindeer turtlenecks I knitted...
HENRY
Doesn t seem so bad. I mean,
better than this...
He nods at the bar. She shakes her head.
CASEY
This isn t what I do. Why don t you
marry my him and go to Burlington?
HENRY
What, and leave show business?

25
24.
EXT. PATIO
Music and patio lights. People scarf buffet food, chatty,
getting some booze in them. Roman spins fun tunes.
LIDDY patrols. Pleased. Party is a success. She takes a
glass of wine from Constance. Smiles at...
RON , who smiles back from the patio bar. He has an audience
of kids and a row of glasses laid out for Shirley Temples.
RON
Hey, who here s seen "Cocktail?"
With Elizabeth Shue?
Ron, happy, goes into a "Cocktail" act, tossing bottles
around frenetically. The kids watch, until one of the kids
suddenly stabs him in the thigh with an olive sword.
RON (CONT'
Fuck me!
The grenadine bottle hits the side of the bar and splashes
red syrup across Ron s uniform from nipple to nuts.
INT. MONICA' S BEDROOM
Kyle and Monica talk. Kyle channelling Jim Morrison.
KYLE
Yeah, the whole suburb trip, man
it' s like mind-j ail. I wrote a song
about it once.
MONICA
Can I hear it?
KYLE
Well, um...
A long awkward beat as Kyle seems to shyly struggle with the
request. Finally:
MONICA
You don t ha--
KYLE
singing)
Gave you my soul
You treat it like poison
Gave you my heart
You betray with a lie.
Now I'm crawling on all fours

. . . 
25.
KYLE (CONT' D)
Just like a baby
But don t hold your brea 
You won t ever see cry.
A pause; Monica almost says how much she loves it when Kyle
hits the " recorded song" function on his cellphone and bursts
into the chorus...
KYLE (CONT'
You stained me.
Like an angel trapped in dirt...
INT. HALLWAY BATHROOM
Ron furiously changes out of his grenadine-stained shirt into
Henry s original wrinkly one. It' s comically tight.
RON
(trying to button it)
God fucking damn it!
He whips out his Shout Stick, and gets to work on the stain
on his trousers. He hears singing from the other room...
INT. MONICA' S BEDROOM
Kyle is finishing up.
KYLE
You stained me
Like Shakespeare said " thou doth"
You stained 
You shan t ever see me cry
A beat, then they start making out, leaning back on the bed.
Monica opens her eyes. She can now see into the bathroom 
Ron squints back at her in the mirror. She can t see the
Shout Stick, so it appears Ron is frantically masturbating.
Monica shrieks. Ron looks over to see her in the mirror,
glances down at his hand, realizes what she must think.
Monica tosses Kyle off the bed and flees. Ron gives chase.
RON
(to Kyle)
RDD!
INT. HALLWAY
Ron catches up with Monica.

27
...
26.
RON
Whoa, whoa. Look, I was just
trying to rub something out.
MONICA
Gross. . .
Ron fumbles to get the Shout Stick out of his pocket.
RON
, no, it' s not --
(fumbling in pocket)
I already used it on your mom, she
thought it was amazing!
MONICA
Mom! !
Ron grabs her arm.
RON
(reasonable)
Please , there s no reason to...
(she struggles - he snaps)
Young lady, this is my job, here.
Don t fuck with me or I swear by
God in heaven I will destroy you.
INT. MONICA' S BEDROOM
Kyle, oblivious to the confrontation outside -- Monica seems
a distant memory -- watches the "I Love the 90s " episode on
VH-l. ONSCREEN - Michael Ian Black quips about the next bit.
MICHAEL IAN BLACK
Are we having fun yet? The answer
in 1998: no... so please tell this
guy to quit asking...
. . . and VH-l cuts to a montage of a 90s-hip beer commercial
campaign for Koontz Beer, in which a bright-eyed twenty-
something guy provides various male-fantasy scenarios to his
buddies -- super models, Super Bowls, Vegas casinos, sports
cars, etc. That bright-eyed guy is HENRY
And every ad culminates in the buoyant campaign tag lie:
HENRY (ON SCREEN)
Are we having fun yet?
Kyle gawks , thinking what we re thinking: how different this
TV Henry looks -- boyishly handsome, buoyant , winning.

27.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Tight on present-day Henry, expressionless. Kinda drunk.
VARIOUS POV SHOTS: the kids are gone. It' s getting louder
and blurrier. A new song gets several ambitious folks to
start dancing, including Heidi-Jane, who winks at Henry.
LIDDY watches, nervous, as her " classy" affair gets messy.
CASEY' S camera catches a pained smile. CONSTANCE jumps in.
CONSTANCE
Who s the hostess with the mostest?
She tries the " Proud Mary" again, but Liddy swats at her.
LIDDY
Don t do that.
Henry pops a Vicodin, downs it with a swig of Scotch out of
the bottle. He looks up -- GORDON WING is leaning on the bar,
drunk, sourly watching his neighbors. He slaps a glass down.
GORDON
Make it a double
(out of nowhere)
I was in a band, too.
Henry pours Gordon a double Scotch/rocks.
HENRY
(also drunk)
m not in a band...
GORDON
We were good. Kind of a Springsteen
meets the Police thing.
dr inks)
I mean, I could have been like you.
I could have done that, but I chose
this. And that' s cool...
(glancing at dancers)
May not look cool , but... in here,
m as cool as you.
HENRY
m not--
GORDON
mon, you re what, an actor?
Living that life?

28.
GORDON (CONT' D)
Everyone knows you, no one ignores
you, get that break and you
rich, free, getting more ass than a
toilet seat?
(Henry shakes his head)
I thought all you waiter guys were
actors. So what do you do?
HENRY
I need to figure that out. What do
you do? Maybe I can do that?
GORDON
Sure, sure. You know anything
about mortgage refinance?
HENRY
(shakes head sadly)
But I do know something about
pouring.
He pours out two drinks. As Henry tops off Gordon s healthy
double, there s a tap on his shoulder.
A very uptight Ron -- in Henry s too-tight shirt and chaffed
trousers -- motions him to the end of the bar. Henry stares,
amused. Ron tries to stage-whisper...
RON
No doubles. One jigger only.
But the music is too loud and Henry can t hear.
HENRY
Wha t?
RON
shouting)
I DON' T--
. . . the song ends, and the whole room goes absurdly quiet...
RON (CONT'
--WANT YOU SERVING THEM TWO
JI GGERS !
Ron turns to find the Ayaams in line at the bar. He freezes,
believing incorrectly that they have misunderstood him.
RON (CONT'
I am-- Ayaam! -- you am-- you are --
it' s bar lingo. Henry, right?

30
29.
HENRY
What is?
Ron, thoroughly tongue-tied, finally just puts his hands
together Hindu- style, and bows deeply to the Ayaams. Remains
bowed. For an uncomfortably long time. Everyone stares.
Henry wordlessly hands the Ayaams two drinks and they leave.
HENRY ( CONT' D)
Ron the preferred term is jig- roes.
Ron fumes, slithers off.
MONICA (0. S. )
The line!
Monica rushes up with Kyle in tow.
MONICA (CONT'
Say the line!
KYLE
Dude, you re that guy! I knew you
were someone! That' s awesome!
can t believe I' m working with you.
mon, do it. Say it, man...
Henry s expression registers utter misery. Suddenly, he
spots someone. A 35- ish guy, determined and unhappy,
scanning the crowd. It' s Casey s husband, MIKE.
HENRY
scuse me...
He approaches Mike. Looking to be a White Knight...
HENRY (CONT' D)
Can I help...
MIKE
m looking for Casey...
Mike looks out through sliding glass doors -- spots Casey
shooting video of party guests. He heads for the patio.
Henry hesitates, then goes after him.
EXT. PATIO - CONTINUOUS
Henry, drunk, trying to be elegant, moves in beside Mike.
HENRY
You her husband?

31
30.
Mike is in no mood. He keeps moving toward Casey.
HENRY (CONT' 
You know, Ron s been riding her all
night. Maybe if wait out front,
I' 11 send her out--
MIKE
Who the hell are you?
HENRY
Nobody. Just... having a bad day,
trying to do one little good deed
here, so if you could...
That' s when drunken Henry walks right into a patio chair,
gets entangled in another, and pratfalls into the pool.
UNDERWATER - tight on Henry s face. It registers almost
nothing -- the odd calm of a self-immolating Buddhist monk.
He settles to the bottom. A beat. Then he surfaces. Strokes
toward the ladder. He glances up...
HENRY' s POV - Mike and Casey are mid-fight in a corner of the
lawn. We can hear just bits and pieces.
. . . it' MIKE
s time for us to grow up!
CASEY
We said five years...
He watches with mixed emotions. We can t tell if he s rooting
for her to leave with her husband or break up and stay.
GORDON (0. C. )
CANNONBALL!
Henry turns to see the naked form of Gordon flying overhead.
Splash! He surfaces, smiling, assuming others will follow.
GORDON (CONT' D)
Hey, who s getting crazy? mon,
the water s fine!
(nods at Henry)
Bartender s with me! He cool!
What' re y all waiting for? The kids
are gone, let' s cut loose, show ' em
how it' s done.

32
31.
Roman stares, shaking his head with disdain. The song ends
and the silence is uncomfortable. Gordon looks around at his
dully- staring neighbors. Gordon segues from jovial to surly.
GORDON ( CONT' D)
Oh? What? Am I the asshole here?
(looking around)
I am! I' m the asshole here!
Henry exits the pool as Liddy reacts, appalled.
LIDDY
Put your clothes on, Gordon. No one
here wants to see your penis.
GORDON
Why? Maybe I' 11 win an awardy for
best cock! I' d rather have a trophy
for best cock on my mantle than
tidiest lawn, or faggiest mailbox
or goddamn Christmas lights -- they
better not blink! No blinking
lights, Neighbors! Ordinary fucking
people! What' s wrong with you?
You re already dead! All of you!
RON
Roman! What am I not hearing?
Ron makes a hand gesture for Roman to play a new song. Roman
nods. "Got it boss. " He slides a new CD in a deck.
MUSIC CUE: Nelly s "Hot In Herre. Ron frowns at him, but
Roman grooves faux-obliviously.
ANGLE ON GORDON who attempts to beach himself. He drunkenly
flops, reaching for his clothes, just out of reach.
HENRY. Drunk, wet, miserable, watches Casey and Mike argue.
ROMAN ( 0 . S . )
It' s over, dude.
ROMAN is also watching the fight.
ROMAN ( CONT' D)
Don t get any ideas, though. I got
first dibs on her for the rebound.
Roman leaves. Henry just shakes his head. Ron appears.
Joins him in shaking his head.

33
. .
32.
RON
Well , what' re you gonna do..
HENRY
(drunk , misunderstanding)
I don t know. I thought I knew, and
now. . . I have no idea. I just feel
like my life is just... shit. 
RON
Yeah, know what you mean. But keep
list,in  it' mind. The Client drew the guest
s her responsibility.
(slapping him on the back)
So chin up. This isn t our fault.
INT. KITCHEN
Constance watches as Kyle stands focused on a message on his
cell phone. Roman wanders in.
ROMAN
Hey, that' s an R.
CONSTANCE
Leave him alone. It' s network! Uh,
m so jealous...
She crosses her fingers, looks up hopefully as he hangs up.
KYLE
They want to take me to network on
The Palisades.
Constance shrieks with joy.
CONSTANCE
That' s great! Now when you go in,
remember - seduce them. Make them--
KYLE (CONT'
But they hated the hair. They want
tougher. Like the hair of someone
who s seen some real shi 
Kyle fidgets with his hair. Constance sees something.
CONSTANCE
Oooh. Don t touch. Back like that,
you look like Jan Michel Vincent.
KYLE
I s he tough?

34
33.
CONSTANCE
To work with , yes. And he s seen
some real shit. Real alcoholism.
ROMAN
(not liking it)
Is your character Barry the GayBot?
KYLE
No. " Jack. " Just got out of juvie.
ROMAN
(aha, I' ve got it)
Dude, know what they do in juvie?
(mimes a buzz-cut)
I saw a clippers in the bathroom.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Henry, hair wet, drunk in Ron s grenadine- splashed shirt,
packs up as the final mingling unfolds. Casey plops the
dormant video on the bar. Pours herself a drink.
CASEY
Well. Thanks for the gesture... I'
really sorry, I forgot...
HENRY
Henry.
CASEY
Henry. Henry.
CASEY (CONT'
He got the job in Bur lington .
(looking up)
Wha t do you think?
She steps up to the portrait behind the bar. Sticks her head
in front of Liddy s. Smiles insanely.
CASEY (CONT'
Who wants smores?"
HENRY
(a beat. He likes her)
Shame. Here we re just getting to
know each other.
(off her hesitation)
You are going, right?
CASEY
What, and leave show business?

35
...
34.
She grabs a crate of empty glasses and heads to the van.
Henry grabs the video camera. Hits record and starts filming
himself -- a variety of manic phony smiles and expressions.
Self-loathing washing over him. He lowers the camera...
revealing Heidi-Jane. She gives him a "gotcha" look.
HEIDI -JANE
I knew I knew you.
A beat. . . then Henry flashes a drunken, what-the-hell grin...
INT. BATHROOM
Casey passes down the hall. Hears a "buzzing" sound, glances
into the bathroom. She shakes her head, calls into the room.
CASEY
Jesus, Kyle, he left that message.
No one called from network.
INT. KITCHEN
Ron goes over paperwork with a dispirited Liddy.
RON
Just sign here. . . and this, here...
LIDDY
(pausing, confused)
I thought was supposed to fill
out the feedback card...
Kyle enters - there s a stripe through his hair, and he s got
a clump of hair in his hand. Roman follows, wheedling.
ROMAN
mon, we re just fooling around.
KYLE
(voice breaking)
Dude, you totally fucked me in the
ass! It' s pilot season, man!
(turning on him)
Jesus, this is all because I said
your script sucks? You ruin my
whole career?
(losing it again)
I mean, Jesus! It' s pilot season!
Roman just stands there. Awkward. Constance puts an arm
around Kyle reassuringly.

36
35.
CONSTANCE
You know, I remember when I was up
for one of the jumpsuit girls in
Cannonball Run, Two. " Right after
my audition, I got hit by a car. I
was disappointed, but in the
hospital? I finally read " Zen and
the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.
Which totally changed my life.
(the lesson?)
So God never closes a door without
opening a window.
KYLE
A window? This is my hair!
INT. LIVING ROOM
The party empties out. Ron, smiling, " job well done, " shakes
bills from the various tip jars onto a table. His smile
fades as he counts. It' s way short of what he promised.
He pulls out his wallet and throws in all the cash he has.
EXT. SIDEWALK
CASEY sits out on the sidewalk beneath a streetlight. Eyes
bleary. Deep in thought. Smoking. Wiping tears.
ACROSS THE STREET - a NEIGHBOR appears. Classic suburban guy
- Tshirt and pajama bottoms - leaving out the trashcans for
next morning. Casey stares at him.
INT. FRONT DOOR
A SLEEPY CHILD stands beside her parents.
WIFE
I thought last year s was better.
CONSTANCE comes hurrying up, all smiles, with a tiny coat.
CONSTANCE
Here we are! It fell under the bed.
She kneels, starts attentively fussing the kid into the coat.
CONSTANCE (CONT' D)
There you go. Let' s get you all
zipped up. That' s nice. Good.
She pats and smooths the coat, smiles at the boy...

37
. . . . " " . . . .
36.
PARENT
Come on, Danny. Bed-time.
until the parents finally have to pull him away.
Constance watches him go. Face blank.
INT. BATHROOM
KYLE faces himself in a mirror - crumbling. A big, dumb
stripe through his beautiful hair. His moj 0 lost...
KYLE
(attempted confidence)
You re in the Palisades now,
homes. You re in the. 
(gives up)
Goddamn it... goddamn it...
INT. MASTER BATHROOM
ROMAN - blank, bitter - sits on the toilet. Finishing a
dump. Sees a photo of Monica in a chearleader outfit.
He takes it out of the frame, puts it in his pocket. Then
heads out, pointedly leaving the toilet un-flushed.
INT. PARTY DOWN VAN
Henry is in the back 0 f the van making out with Heidi-Jane.

HEIDI -JANE
mon. Please. You can do it. Just
once. Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeease.
Hold on Henry s face as he finds his reflection in the rear-
view mirror. He gives himself a drunk, curdled smile...
HENRY
Are we having fun yet?"
ROLL CREDITS
INT. DRIVEWAY - LATER
Ron moves down the line of resentful waiters. Restless Casey.
Grateful Constance. Distant Kyle. Smirking Roman. And Henry.
RON
Fourteen dollars... Fourteen
dollars. .. Fourteen dollars. 
FADE TO BLACK.
