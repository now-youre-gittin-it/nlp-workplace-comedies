DENNIS
Another big night, fellas. One
Hundred eighty four dollars and
sixty-seven cents.
MAC
Jesus Christ.
CHARLIE
On a Thursday night?
DENNIS
And our mortgage is due in two
weeks.
MAC
Didn't we just pay that goddamn
thing like a week ago?
DENNIS
Yes, Mac. And a week ago we were
three weeks late.
CHARLIE
What are we gonna do?
DENNIS
I don't know, Charlie. But, then
again, I don't know why I got into
business with you boners in the
first place, so I'm probably not
the right person to ask.
MAC
Dennis, take it easy.
DENNIS
Take it easy? If we don't start
making some money, we're gonna lose
the bar.
CHARLIE
We are not gonna lose the bar.
MAC
Let's not get hysterical, please.
SWEET DEE
(quickly)
Alright, listen. I met new this guy
in my acting class. He's perfect
for me and he wants to see where I
work, so I told him we'd stop in.
He's parking the car now, could you
guys please, be cool for me?
MAC
Sweet Dee, of course we'll be cool.
SWEET DEE
I'm really into this guy, okay? So,
please be nice.
DENNIS
When are we not nice, sis? I think--
DENNIS
Oh hey man, we're closed.
TERRELL
Yeah, I know.
MAC
Whoa, we're not looking for any
trouble, man.
TERRELL
What?
SWEET DEE
Guys. This is Terrell. From my
acting class.
CHARLIE
Oh.
DENNIS
Oh, okay. Right.
TERRELL
How you doin'?
MAC
Good. Good, man.
Silence.
TERRELL
Guess you guys don't have a lot of
brothers walking in here, huh?
DENNIS
No man!
MAC
That's not it!
DENNIS
That's not it at all!
CHARLIE
We have plenty of brothers...black
people...
DENNIS
African American. African American
people coming in all the time.
MAC
You might know some of them...
TERRELL
Yeah, we're probably related.
MAC
No, that's not what I meant. I
wasn't implying that you're all
related.
DENNIS
He wasn't implying-
MAC
It was just that Sweet Dee said
that, uh...
CHARLIE
We weren't expecting Dee to...
MAC
We just didn't expect you to be
black.

TERRELL
Right.
SWEET DEE
Thanks guys.

TERRELL
I'm promoting you better
believe it's gonna be everybody and
their momma trying to get in. White
boys, brothas, Latinos, whatever.
We got niggas hanging from the
rafters!
CHARLIE
Absolutely.
TERRELL
So we got like four hundred plus
packed into this place.
DENNIS
Four hundred?!
TERRELL
No joke. And it's mostly college
kids. My sista goes to Temple and
she's got the hookups there.
MAC
Hookups are good. Point of
clarification. When you say
"sista", you mean...
TERRELL
I mean my sister.
MAC
Great. It's just that sometimes it
could mean your friend, or you know-
CHARLIE
Mac, shut up.
TERRELL
SO we all packed into this tiny
little place on Walnut. We like
half way through the night,
everything's goin' fine when all of
a sudden, I see this dude eye
ballin me from across the bar.
And I'm like, you know, I don't
know if this dude wants to freak me
or fight me, you know what I'm
sayin'?
MAC
Totally!
CHARLIE
This dude's givin' you crazy eyes!
TERRELL
So, I walk over to the dude. He's
this big, cut, Mexican mofo. And
I'm like Yo' esse, unless you
wanna get yo' ass torn apart yo
betta get that look off yo' face.
MAC
You just walked right up to him and
said that?
TERRELL
I had to make the first move, son.
Always make the first move!
MAC
Badass.
SWEET DEE
So what happened?
TERRELL
This dude, just kept staring me
down. So we like eye ball to eye
ball. I'm three inches from this
dude's grill. It feels like
eternity, son! Then he finally
opens his mouth...and says: "I
guess you gonna have to tear my ass
apart then, holmes."
MAC
Oh shit.
SWEET DEE
Oh my God. What did you do?
TERRELL
I had no choice... I took him to
the back alley... and I tore his
ass apart.
SWEET DEE
Wow.
MAC
You are the man!
MAC (0.S.)
I love that guy!
MAC
"I took him to the back alley
Who does shit like that? It's like
a movie!
DENNIS
I don't know. There was something
about him that was a little off.
MAC
Uh...racist.
DENNIS
No asshole. That's not what I
meant.
CHARLIE
I'il get the coffee. What do you
guys want?
DENNIS
Dude, just wait until the waitress
comes out here. You can stare at
her then.

CHARLIE
I wasn't going to stare at her.
DENNIS
Sure you weren't. It's pathetic,
Charlie, you're totally obsessed
with that chick.
CHARLIE
I am not.
DENNIS
It's never gonna happen, dude.
MAC
Hey, we should totally hire
Terrell!
DENNIS
I don't know.
MAC
Dude, you heard him. When he's
promotin', everybody and they
mommas are lookin' to get in.
CHARLIE
Yeah. They have niggers hanging
from rafters.
WAITRESS
Wow. Nice.
CHARLIE
No, I was quoting-
I was quoting a black...great, now
she thinks I'm racist.
DENNIS
I thought you said you weren't into
her.
CHARLIE
I'm not. It's just...that, I don't
want her thinking that.
MAC
Den, let's give Terrell a shot. If
he delivers half of what he
promises, we're looking at like two
hundred people.
DENNIS
It would be nice to actually get
some chicks into Paddy's. Alright,
let's give him a shot.
CHARLIE
You sure about this?
MAC
It's two thousand five, Charlie.
Don't you think it's a damn shame
that you have no friends outside of
your own race.
CHARLIE
So what are you planning to do?
MAC
We're gonna go in there and try to
diversify. Make friends with people
of other cultures, you know,
broaden our horizons.
CHARLIE
You just wanna impress Terrell with
new black friends.
MAC
Charlie. Don't be a dick.
DAMON
I'm a bust that shit up, Reese. I'm
a bust that shit up!

MAC
Eventually, the attention is taken off Mac, and the game
resumes.
MAC
Sort of a hostile environment.
Maybe we need to rethink this.
KAREN
Hey. What's your name?
CHARLIE
Charlie.
KAREN
Do you play bones, Charlie?
CHARLIE
I dabble.
KAREN
Do you wanna play? I could get you
a game.
CHARLIE
I really shouldn't. I'm not very
good.
KAREN
Oh, that doesn't matter.
CHARLIE
It's been a long time.
KAREN
Oh, come on.
CHARLIE
Well, maybe just one game.
CHARLIE
Domino, bitch!
MAC
This is bullshit, dude. Absolute
bullshit. Why do those people like
you more than they like me?
CHARLIE
Maybe it's comments like that.
MAC
I meant those people in there. In
that room. Not all black people.
What am I supposed to say in that
situation?
JANELLE
Hey. I'm Janelle.
CHARLIE
Hey.
JANELLE
You got nice moves, Charlie.
CHARLIE
Oh. Thanks.
Janelle slips him a piece of paper.
JANELLE
I wanted to give you this. Give me
a call sometime.
CHARLIE
Yeah, okay, sure.

MAC
What are you doing, dude?
CHARLIE
What?
MAC
How could you blow that chick off?
That chick is gorgeous and it's
like the perfect opportunity to
prove we are not racist.
CHARLIE
Well, I think, if anything, we
should be focused on black men.
MAC
What the hell are you talking
about? You've gotta call this girl.
CHARLIE
She's not really what we need. We
need black guys.
wa
Guys? Why does it have to be guys?
MAC (CONT'D)
Is this about that waitress?
CHARLIE
What? No.
MAC
It's never gonna happen, dude.
You've gotta stop with this shit.
CHARLIE
I don't care about that.
MAC
Let me see your wallet.
CHARLIE
Why?
MAC
Do you still have a picture of her
in your wallet?

CHARLIE
No, dude,
MAC
Let me see it.
CHARLIE
Dude, don't! Give me it!
MAC
(threatening to rip it)
Eh? Eh?
CHARLIE
No don't. Okay, fine. call the
black girl. I'll call her.

SWEET DEE
I had the strangest dream last
night. I was in Cleveland, Ohio,
which is really funny cause I've
never been to Ohio.
DENNIS
I don't want to hear about your
dreams, Dee. I hate listening to
people's dreams. It's like flipping
through a stack of photographs I'm
not in. I don't care.
TERRELL
Yo, wassup?
Sweet Dee instantly sweetens.

SWEET DEE
Hey!
DENNIS
Hey, Terrell, how you doing?
TERRELL
Come here. I wanna show you
somethin'.
TERRELL
Rule number one. Always keep a
line.
DENNIS
This is crazy!
SWEET DEE
I told you! Terrell is the best!
DENNIS
I'm gonna have to start bartending
full time! Look at this!
SWEET DEE
Why are you getting more tips than
me?
DENNIS
I don't know.
MAC
Jesus! This is crazy!
DENNIS
He really packed them in, huh?
MAC
Yeah.
CHARLIE
This is crazy!
DENNIS
I know! We were just saying that!
CHARLIE
No fights? Nothing?
DENNIS
Not a thing! It's a nice crowd.
Well behaved.
CHARLIE
Lotta dudes.
DENNIS
Yeah. Lotta dudes.
MAC
Ton of dudes.
HANDSOME GUY
Excuse me, bartender?
SWEET DEE
What can I get you boys?

HANDSOME GUY
We'd actually like to wait for the
other one.
SWEET DEE
What other one?
CHARLIE
Hey, Mac isn't that your
Brett? cousin,
MAC
Yo, Brettty Boy!
BRETT
Hey, cuz!
MAC
What's going on, dude?!
CHARLIE
Hey, Brett. Do you believe this?
It's crazy, right?
BRETT
It's something else!
DENNIS
Gentlemen, I understand my services
have been requested.
HANDSOME GUY
I have a couple of services I'd
like to request.
DENNIS
Whoa! Hey, what are doing?
HANDSOME GUY
You have the most beautiful eyes.
DENNIS
I'm not...I just- Really? You think
SO?
HANDSOME GUY
So blue.
DENNIS
It's more of a blue-green actually.
SWEET DEE (0.S.)
Dennis!
DENNIS
Could you excuse me for a sec?
SWEET DEE
You getting a strange vibe in here?
DENNIS
Yup.
BRETT
Did you guys put this party
together yourself?
MAC
No we had a promoter.
BRETT
I just had to see it for myself.
CHARLIE
What do you mean?
BRETT
You guys own the hottest gay bar in
Philadelphia.
SWEET DEE
How could you not tell me you were
gay?!
TERRELL
I'm a musical theater actor living
in Philadelphia. I didn't think it
was a big secret.
SWEET DEE
But, I've been coming on to you for
weeks !
TERRELL
I just thought you were into gay
dudes.
SWEET DEE
I am not into gay dudes.
TERRELL
Apparently you are.
SWEET DEE
Well, the guys hired you to promote
for them and you turned their bar
into a gay bar. They're totally
pissed!
DENNIS
(all smiles)
Nine thousand, five hundred, fifty-
three dollars and sixty-seven
cents!

CHARLIE
In one night!
DENNIS
We made more money in one night
than in the entire year we've owned
this place.
CHARLIE
This is the greatest thing that's
ever happened to us! I think we
should totally embrace the
situation.
DENNIS
Me too!
CHARLIE
I'm a little worried about Mac.
DENNIS
I wouldn't worry about Mac. He can
be quite open-minded.
MAC
No goddamn way.
MAC
Have you seen this?
MAC
"Looking for that new hot spot to
spot that stud? Well, Paddy's Irish
Pub has plugged that hole."
CHARLIE
That's a nice notice.
MAC
No it's not! I don't want to he
plugging any holes.

SWEET DEE
I agree with Mac on this one.
DENNIS
Of course you do. I made three
hundred dollars in tips last night.
How much did you make?
SWEET DEE
That's not the point!
DENNIS
Sure it isn't, Dee.
CHARLIE
I don't think we have much of a
choice.
MAC
If you assholes recall, one of the
reasons we bought that shit hole in
the first place was to get laid!
CHARLIE
Maybe all you wanted was to get
laid, but I, my friend, have a
little something called business
ethics.
MAC
Shut up, Charlie. The only reason
you don't care is because you have
black girls hanging all over you.
But you know what, dude? You're
gonna screw it up.
CHARLIE
Screw it up? I'm sorry, my friend,
but I actually have a date with one
of them today.
DENNIS
Look, Mac, It's a purely fiscal
decision,
SWEET DEE
That's bullshit, Dennis. This has
nothing to do with money. You just
like all the attention.
DENNIS
What's that supposed to mean?

SWEET DEE
You know exactly what I mean pretty
boy.
GUY
Hey, handsome.
GUY 2
Hey, beautiful.
GUY 3
Hey, sexy.
GUY 4
Hey, gorgeous.
DENNIS
Hay.
DENNIS
I just get along with those guys.
SWEET DEE
You're leading them on! You're not
gay! You're just vain!
CHARLIE
All in favor of Paddy's remaining
the hottest gay bar in Philly say,
"Aye we .

CHARLIE/DENNIS
aye.
CHARLIE
Opposed-
DENNIS
-Keeping in mind that you're only
the bartender Dee, and not an
owner, so you don't get a vote.
MAC
She gets a vote!
SWEET DEE
I get a vote!
CHARLIE
Opposed?
MAC
Nay. Aww, this is bullshit!
CHARLIE
The Aye's have it! Paddy's Irish
Pub will remain the hottest gay bar
in Philly.

CHARLIE
Wow. You look great.
JANELLE
Thanks, Charlie. So, where to?
CHARLIE
I thought we'd go grab a drink.
JANELLE
Oh. A coffee shop. Okay... I
thought you meant like a drink at a
bar.


CHARLIE
Yeah, absolutely. Let's sit here.
go up. What can I get you?
JANELLE
I don't really drink coffee.
CHARLIE
Totally.
Charlie walks up to the waitress at the counter.
WAITRESS
What do you want, Charlie?
CHARLIE
I'd like you to take a look at the
beautiful African American girl
sitting at that table there.
WAITRESS
Okay?
CHARLIE
That woman is my friend.
WAITRESS
Good for you.
CHARLIE
So, you see, the other day, when
you heard me saying something about
"people" hanging from rafters-
WAITRESS
What do you want?
CHARLIE
Maybe now that you know I am not
racist, maybe we could-
WAITRESS
Dude. N.O. How many times am I
going to have to say it?
JANELLE
What's going on over here?
WAITRESS
Charlie's using you to prove he's
not racist. Then he asked me on a
date.
JANELLE
Charlie? Is this true?
CHARLIE
Well-
SWEET DEE
I think you should see a doctor,
Charlie. This looks bad.
CHARLIE
I already went. He told me Janelle
almost cracked my skull.
SWEET DEE
Just make sure you keep this thing-
wait, what did you say this girl's
name is?
CHARLIE
Janelle. Jenkins. She told me if
she ever saw me again she'd slit my
throat. I believe her.
SWEET DEE
And you met her at Temple?
CHARLIE
Yeah.
Sweet Dee realizes something.
MAC
Are you two seeing this?
DENNIS
The boys are out tonight, huh?!
They stare in horror.
MAC
This is unbelievable.
You've got black women crawling all
over you.
And this Mary over here is the
belle of the ball. Why do these
people like you guys so much?
CHARLIE
It's not that they like us, Mac.
It's that they don't like you.
Nobody likes you. Because you're an
asshole.
Charlie walks off.
MAC
Is that true?
SWEET DEE
Yeah, kinda. Listen, we need to
talk.

SWEET DEE
This girl that Charlie's talking
about from Temple, Janelle Jenkins?
I know her.
MAC
So what?
Sweet Dee smiles.
SWEET DEE
I think I know how to make things
normal around here. Okay, first off
we need to deal with Dennis. I want
you to get him wasted tonight.
Blackout wasted. You feed him
enough tequila to kill a horse. Can
you do that?
MAC
No problen.
Sweet Dee heads for the door.
MAC
Where are you going?
SWEET DEE
I need to talk to a couple of
friends from my acting class. Then
I'm going up to Temple. Just make
sure Dennis gets hammered. Black
out hammered.

MAC
I'm pretty sure the lime goes
first.
DENNIS
No, dude, the salt's first.
MAC
Nope. It's the lime.
DENNIS
Watch.
DENNIS
There. You see?
MAC
So you do the shot first? Wait a
second, do it again.
DENNIS
You're pathetic, dude.


DENNIS
Oh my God.
He looks around.
DENNIS (CONT'D)
Where the hell am I?
DENNIS (CONT'D)
Hey now?
DENNIS (CONT'D)
Nice.
DENNIS (CONT'D)
Very nice.
BOY
Hey lover.
DENNIS
Whoa! No! No! This is not...I
don't....what happened here?
BOY
What do you mean?
DENNIS
What's going on!? What happened
here?
BOY
Relax stud. You got nothing to be
ashamed about.
DENNIS
What the hell are you...did
we...did we have...
BOY
No silly.
DENNIS
Oh my God. Thank God.
BOY
It was all hands.
LARGE MAN IN TOWEL
Hey! My boys are up!
LARGE MAN IN TOWEL (CONT'D)
How's that ass feeling?
CHARLIE (0.S.)
I'm really glad you decided to
embrace this, Mac.

MAC
Yeah, me too.
CHARLIE
I really just think this is a great
business decision.
MAC
Yeah. I guess I just decided that
you guys were right. I think owning
a gay bar is a great idea.

DENNIS
I don't wanna own a gay bar
anymore.
CHARLIE
What?!
MAC
Oh no. What happened?
DENNIS
I've just been doing some thinking
and I feel like we had our little
experiment but it's time to go back
to normal.
MAC
You're done experimenting? All done
with the experiments?
DENNIS
With the bar. The experiment with
the bar.
CHARLIE
But Terrell's helping us
redecorate. He's really pumped.

TERRELL
Hey, Dennis. I brought some new
music for the jukebox. The stuff
you guys have in there's a little
dated. Now, I think the first thing
we do is get rid of all these
shamrocks.
DENNIS
Terrell we have to talk.

phone.
MAC (0.8.)
Everybody's here.
SWEET DEE
Alright, we're right outside.

TERRELL
I don't understand. I thought you
guys were happy.
MAC
Dennis had his experiment and
changed his mind.
DENNIS
With the bar, dude! Stop saying it
like that.
TERRELL
I think you guys are being
ridiculous.
CHARLIE
Me too! I thought we were trying to
be open minded! I thought we wanted
to expand our horizons!
SWEET DEE
Hey, everybody!
MAC
Hey, Dee! Look, everybody! Sweet
Dee's here!
JANELLE
Charlie?
CHARLIE
Oh shit!
JANELLE
What the hell are you doing here?
CHARLIE
Look, okay, I said I was sorry! You
smashed my face, what else do you
want?!
TERRELL
Janelle?

JANELLE
Terrell? What the hell you hangin'
out with this dickhead for?
DENNIS
What's going on?
MAC
Do you two know each other?
CHARLIE
This is the bitch that cracked my
skull!
TERRELL
Charlie. This is Janelle.
(beat)
My sister.
CHARLIE
Your sister?
TERRELL
Yeah.
MAC
Point of clarification. Your
"sista"?
TERRELL
My sister.
MAC
Right!
MAC
So you're actually related?
TERRELL
Yeah.
MAC
Ha! Earlier you were implying that
I was racist because you thought
that I was implying that all black
people are related and then it
turns out that you people actually
are.
MAC
I mean you people. You two. Not all
black people.
SWEET DEE
Mac, shut up.
TERRELL
I quit.
BLACK.

SWEET DEE
One hundred twenty nine, one
hundred thirty... one hundred +
thirty one dollars and twenty cents.
MAC
On a Saturday night.
SWEET DEE
Not bad.
MAC
So, Dee-- I have to know... what
exactly did you tell your friends
from acting class to say to Dennis
that get him so freaked out?
SWEET DEE
Oh, I forgot to tell you - that
didn't work out.
MAC
What?
SWEET DEE
Yeah, I couldn't get a hold of
them.
MAC
So why was he so freaked out?
SWEET DEE
I don't know...
They consider this for a moment as we:
