ACT ONE 
VT: SERIES OF SWEEPING SHOTS OF FAMOUS LANDMARKS 
We see shots of famous political images -- the Capitol 
Building, floor of the Senate, a recent Presidential 
inauguration, the White House, Mount Rushmore, etc. 
LESLIE (V.0.) 
I love politics. I've always loved 
politics. "The game." 
B -Roll: SLOW PAN OVER some BOOKSHELVES. Nothing but 
Political biographies. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
Some people say that politics is show 
business for ugly people. I disagree. 
It's show business for real people -- 
people whose talents aren't dancing and 
singing, but rather talking and talking. 
INT. LESLIE'S OFFICE - DAY 
ANGLE ON: a framed copy of the Constitution...a portrait of 
Thomas Jefferson... 
LESLIE (V.0.) 
I just...I love the majesty of the 
political system. I live for it. I 
would say that my greatest dream is to be 
elected President of the United States of 
America. 
REVEAL: LESLIE (AMY POEHLER) 
In her office, she is framed by an American flag, and a flag 
of the state of Indiana. A nameplate on the desk reads 
"Leslie Knope." She's wearing a beige pantsuit. 
LESLIE 
My name is Leslie Knope. And I am the 
Deputy Chairwoman of the Department of 
Parks and Recreation in the city of 
Pawnee, Indiana. 
Camera widens to see that her office is small and cramped, 
and not all that impressive. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
Can you get wide enough to see the flag? 
We widen further to see that there is another desk in her 
room, with a piece of another guy (TOM) typing at something.

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM 
RON SWANSON, 40s, midwestern, leads a meeting of the Parks 
Department. LESLIE, TOM (Aziz Ansari), and various OTHERS. 
RON 
Internal Auditing wants to remind all 
government employees that any gift given 
by a member of the public valued at over 
$25 has to be reported immediately. 
One employee looks a little worried. 
EMPLOYEE 
Ron, what about, like, a gift 
certificate? Would that count? 
RON 
How much? 
EMPLOYEE 
Two hundred dollars. 
• RON 
(yes, dummy) 
...Yes. That would count. You can't win, just 
report it and add to the endless red tape. 
LESLIE 
Of course report it! 
(off their looks) 
It's the smart play. The last thing we need is the 
press breathing down our neck. Am I right, Ron? I 
am agreeing with you. 
People stare at her. Ron sighs. 
RON 
Lastly, tonight is the Community Outreach Public 
Forum. Leslie's gonna run it. 
She grins. 
RON (CONT'D)  
We need one more. Who wants in? 
No one volunteers.

LESLIE TALKING HEAD 
LESLIE 
Every month the city government holds a 
public forum and every month, out of over 
600 city workers, I'm the one they send. 
(shrugging) 
It's pretty cool. Whatever. No big 
deal. Just an honor. 
RON TALKING HEAD 
RON 
No one else wants to do it. It's a 
terrible job, going to some dingy rec 
center and getting yelled at by the 
public. I hate the public. The public 
is stupid.

Leslie and Torn are in a SCHOOL HALLWAY outside an AUDITORIUM. 
LESLIE 
(to camera) 
This'll be really good for you guys to 
see. This is where the rubber of 
government meets the road of actual human 
beings. When I go through those doors, I 
have to be on, like the White House Press 
Secretary. So. Deep breath. 
(she takes one) 
Let's rock and roll. 
Leslie tries the DOOR. It's LOCKED. She jiggles it many 
times. Locked. Beat. Tom snickers and points at her.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - NIGHT 
Colorful children's ART hangs on the walls. Leslie and Tom 
each have an (unnecessary, now that they're in a small room) 
MICROPHONE, like in a Senate hearing. 
About 40 of those little chair-desk combo seats are filled 
with people, and more stand along the walls -- mostly 
elderly, all races. Among them is ANN (late 20's, pretty 
without trying). 
Leslie finishes writing her NAME and TITLE on the blackboard. 
LESLIE 
Thank you all for coming. My name is 
Parks Department Deputy Chairwoman Leslie 
Knope. 
She casually sits on the edge of one of the tiny desks and 
TIPS OVER. She recovers, and sits on the teacher's desk. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
With me today is department member Tom 
Haverford. 
Tom notices with irritation people's confused faces. 
TOM TALKING HEAD 
TOM 
Yes, when I was 18 I changed my name from 
Aziz Abdul A1'Rahman to Tom Haverford. 
The cold hard fact is that dark-skinned 
people with funny-sounding Muslim names 
just don't make it very far in politics. 
(jump cut) 
Yes, okay, fine, Barack Obama. Why does 
everyone always bring up Barack Obama? 
That's one counter-example! 
BACK TO SCENE 
Leslie holds court.  
LESLIE (V.0.) 
And yes, I do call myself a "Deputy 
Chairwoman." Politics is changing in 
this country -- it's not just a boys club 
anymore. There are 18 million cracks in 
the glass ceiling, thanks to people like 
me, and Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, 
and, um... Margaret Thatcher. And Nancy 
Pelosi. The Parks Department is the site 
of another one of those cracks.

And over the course of my political 
career, I intend to go around making 
thousands of more cracks in things, if 
not outright shattering and destroying 
them. 
She smiles broadly. 
LESLIE (CONT'D)  
Big turnout tonight! Very exciting. 
We see the front row is mostly old people and weirdos. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
So fire away! Yes? 
Ann raises her hand. A MAN stands aggressively and starts 
talking. 
MAN 
I am here because of a crime that is 
happening right now all over this city, 
that you people know about and do nothing 
to stop. 
LESLIE 
That's horrible. 
MAN 
Will you commit right now to helping me 
stop this crime? 
LESLIE 
Absolutely. We want to serve you in any 
way we can. 
Tom shakes his head in disgust at her naivete. 
MAN 
Do you want me to tell you what the crime 
is? 
LESLIE 
Yes. Please, tell me, so I can help you 
stop it. I don't understand why you're 
being so mysterious about this. 
MAN 
It's abortion. 
Leslie winces, glances to camera, embarrassed. 
TOM  
Abortion's legal, dude.

MAN 
You promised to stop it. 
(holds up mini recorder) I

LESLIE 
Sir, first of all, that was a really mean 
trap. But more importantly, the city 
government doesn't have the ability to 
overturn a Supreme Court decision-- 
MAN 
I think you could, if you weren't so 
lazy. Mayor Havlicek could. 
LESLIE TALKING HEAD 
LESLIE 
Mayor Havlicek was mayor when I was a 
kid. He was quite an old-school 
character. 
• B roll: photo of brutal-looking man in a suit. 
LESLIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) 
He might have been able to overturn a 
Supreme Court ruling. He died in a small 
plane accident when he was thrown out in 
handcuffs at 20,000 feet. 
Widen to reveal the picture is on the front page of the 
Pawnee Journal, with headline: Mayor Meets Grisly End. 
BACK TO SCENE 
He sits. Leslie gathers herself. Ann still has her hand up. 
ANN 
Um...I have -- 
Another MAN stands. 
OTHER MAN 
When they gonna open up Ramsett Park  
again? It's been closed for a year. 
LESLIE 
• Yes, we are trying hard to get that park 
reopened. There was a new problem 
recently...what was it, Tom? 
TOM 
Angry dogs.

Dogs. That's right. There was a pack of 
scary dogs who were attacking the park 
workers, and we said, unh unh. Read our 
lips. "Dogs can't bite people!" 
Leslie glances around to see how her tough-talking is 
received. The old people stare impassively like cows. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
So we are looking into the problem. 
(she makes a note) 
Who's next? 
Ann waves her hand frantically. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
Yes, Barry, go ahead. 
A 50-ish WEIRDO, BARRY, stands up, very animated and 
inexplicably super sarcastic. 
BARRY 
Well, well, well -- today is a great day! 
Because last month they put me in jail. 
That's right! And my mother had a 
restaurant in this town. A creamery. The 
head of the police is a ninth degree 
 mason. 
TOM TALKING HEAD 
TOM 
There are a few regulars who always show 
up to our meetings and ramble on about 
stuff. Leslie says we should listen to 
them like we'd listen to anyone else. I 
prefer: mocking them. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Close on Tom, snickering as he listens to Barry's ramblings. 
BARRY 
One day there was a fire. And that's 
what killed my snake. Now I have a few 
things to say about Laura Linney. 
LESLIE 
Okay, Barry, thank you.

No, no, I want to hear what he has to say 
about Laura Linney.

Tom starts CLAPPING sarcastically. He whistles. 
TOM 
I agree with a lot of what he said. 
Barry wanders out the door. Leslie spins for camera. 
LESLIE 
This is valuable. Citizen comments. 
Who's next? 
Ann has her hand up. Another guy starts to get up and talk 
and Ann just shouts it out. 
ANN 
Hi. So, I'm Ann Logan, and a few of us 
are here to talk about the abandoned lot 
on Sullivan Street. 
LESLIE 
Alright. Go on. 
ANN 
I'm a nurse, and frankly I'm not at all 
interested in politics. 
This gets some claps; Leslie looks insulted. 
ANN (CONT'D) 
But this thing almost killed my 
boyfriend, so... 
 EXT. STREET - PAWNEE, INDIANA - MORNING - B -ROLL 
This footage is shot on a different day -- the documentary 
crew has followed Ann, after hearing her issue at the 
meeting, and is splicing in this footage to illustrate what 
 she talked about. 
We're on an unimpressive street full of shops with apartments 
and small homes behind them.

ANN (V.0.) 
Anyway, on this lot near my house, a 
developer dug out a basement for an 
office building, and then they went 
bankrupt. And now, there's just...this 
giant pit. 
We look over at a GIANT PIT, maybe 15 feet deep, dug out of 
the ground. It is surrounded by a construction fence that is 
rotting and busted down in places -- this has clearly been 
here for a while. Ann looks to camera and silently points 
out sections of the pit as we hear the conversation at the 
meeting continue. 
ANN (V.0.) (CONT'D) 
It's been there almost a year. 
LESLIE (V.0.) 
Twelve months, yes, go on. 
ANN (V.0.) 
It goes right up to the backyard of the 
house I rent. 
BACK TO MEETING SCENE 
ANN 
And my boyfriend -- who's a musician 
actually, who I support, but who was 
really starting to make some contacts and 
apply himself in the music business -- 
anyway, he was cutting through the lot at 
night, and it was raining, and he just -- 
whoomp! -- fell right in. Broke both his 
legs.

Andy is on his couch, both his legs in a cast.

"Unemployed man breaks legs in abandoned

"unemployed" man? That is inappropriate 
editorializing that doesn't belong in a 
news piece, in my opinion. 
LESLIE 
(shaking her head) 
It's the gotcha media. 
ANN 
The point is, there's a giant hole in the 
ground and people are falling in. I've 
been trying for months to get someone to 
fix this problem -- I've written letters, 
and I've made like a thousand phone calls 
to the government, but so far... 
She makes a zero with her fingers. 
TOM 
Who fell in again? Your boyfriend? 
 • Yeah. ANN 
TOM 
Is he dead? 
ANN 
No. But he broke his legs. 
TOM 
Uh huh. How long you guys been together? 
Is it a strong relationship? 
Ann looks at him a little warily. 
TOM (CONT'D) 
I'm not hitting on you. I'm married. 
am only asking for background purposes.

Well, guess what? I'm not going to blow 
you off. 
ANN

Really. 
LESLIE 
Yes. I will help you. 
ANN 
Is that a promise?

I will help. And not only will we fill in 
that pit, but we will put a beautiful new 
park on that land.

I've been in the parks department for six 
years, and until now I've only really 
been able to engage in park maintenance. 
For example, last year I led the city- 
wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand 
after those problems with the cats. I 
heard some testimony from mothers of 
toddlers that would make you cry. But 
this pit! The chance to build a new 
park, from scratch...

A park. Huh.

nuts...it's impossible.
