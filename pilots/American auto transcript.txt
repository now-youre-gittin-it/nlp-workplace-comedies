KATHERINE (V.O.)
I’m just not sure I like the name 
“Ponderosa” for a car. 
ELLIOT
It tested well. People thought it evoked 
feelings of nature and strength. 
KATHERINE
It sounds like “ponderous” to me, like 
“dull”, like a dull, ponderous car. 
ELLIOT
It comes from the Ponderosa pine tree. 
KATHERINE
Do people want to drive a tree? 
ELLIOT
Um...
SADIE 
Not a literal tree, it’s just the vibe. 
CYRUS 
There’s a Ponderosa lemon. 
KATHERINE 
Isn’t a lemon literally how people refer 
to a bad car? Might as well name it the 
Payne Clunker. 
WESLEY 
It sounds dirty to me. Like pon sounds 
like poon, which means vagina, and de 
rosa means “of pink”, so it’s like we’re 
saying it’s a big pink vagina. 
SADIE 
No wonder it tested well. 
KATHERINE 
Wasn’t there some car name that meant 
something bad in Spanish? 
ELLIOT 
A bunch of them. The Chevy Nova, the 
Mazda LaPuta, the Mitsubishi Pajero. 
SADIE 
You’d think multibillion dollar companies 
would hire at least one guy who spoke 
Spanish. 
KATHERINE 
Does anyone here speak Spanish? 
SADIE 
Jesus, people. 
DORI 
I’ll look it up. 
CYRUS 
Ponderosa is also a species of snail.
KATHERINE
So there’s the Mustang, the Jaguar, the
Thunderbird, and now we’ve got the Snail? 
ELLIOT 
Seems pretty stupid to me. 
DORI 
Okay, it says Ponderosa means “powerful” 
in Spanish. 
SADIE
There you go. 
DORI
Although it means “weighty” in Basque.
CYRUS 
Who cares what it means in Basque?
WESLEY
Oh, I don’t know, maybe about 2 million
proud Basquianis. Do you know how
ignorant you sound?
DORI
And in Urdu, ponderosa means “subsidized”. 
KATHERINE
Urdu?
SADIE 
Pakistan.
ELLIOT
Oh, you do not want to piss them off.
(then)
I mean because of the size of the market,
not...
(explosion sound)
He makes a gesture of a suicide vest exploding.
WESLEY
“Who cares what it means in Basque?” Say
that in Bilbao, why don’t you?
KATHERINE 
Are we overthinking this? 
SADIE 
Ummm..... 
DORI
In Greek, “po nde rosa” means “I’m
sharing ducks”. 
SADIE 
I think we might be, yeah. 
KATHERINE 
Okay fine, let’s stick with Ponderosa. 
Now, if we were going to design a car 
called the Ponderosa, what might that 
look like? 
WESLEY
My great-great-grandfather would be
rolling over in his grave if he saw that 
woman running the company he founded. 
ELLIOT
Because he hated women?
DORI
I thought he hated communists.
CYRUS
He hated Irishmen. 
WESLEY
No! Because Paynes have been running 
Payne Motors for over a hundred years. 
And then in just six weeks, this rando 
starts changing everything we love about 
this place. 
He picks up some paper straws. 
WESLEY (CONT’D) 
You see this? Farewell plastic straws. 
CYRUS 
We haven’t had plastic straws for like 
two years. 
WESLEY 
Really? I never use them. 
ELLIOT
She was pretty successful at that drug 
company.
WESLEY
Cars aren’t drugs. You can’t get a bunch
of grandmas addicted to cars and then go:
(closes eyes, hands over ears)
I don’t see anything wrong going on, Nana
must just keep dropping her pills down
the drain, I guess.
DORI
I’ve gotta step up my game. With a male
boss, you can skate by with a little
flirting, or a low-cut top. You can’t
flirt with a woman.
(then, considers)
Well, I guess you can, technically.
(quietly, like it’s gossip)
My niece, we’re like 95% sure.
ELLIOT
You’ll be fine. If she fires anyone,
it’ll probably be me.
CYRUS
Or me.
ELLIOT
Well it should be you.
KATHERINE 
“The car boasts an electric hybrid engine 
and a lightweight aluminum...”
(shows card to Sadie)
How do you pronounce this? Chassis? Chassees?
(throat-sound)
Chass-ees?
SADIE
Chassis.
KATHERINE
Chassis. Chassis. Chassis. (making a mneumonic) “I put on my glasses to see the chassis.”
SADIE 
The reporters are getting here at 5:00, 
so I figured we could test drive the 
prototype before it starts. 
KATHERINE 
And they don’t know the car is self- 
driving yet? 
SADIE 
No, the invite just said it would be a 
“revolution in transportation”. So this 
is gonna be a very big deal. 
(then) 
I was also thinking that, since it’s your 
first big press event as CEO, you could 
say a few words about how excited you are 
to be here, what you love about cars. 
KATHERINE
Honestly, I’m not really a “car person”. 
If anything, I think it’s a little weird 
how much some people fetishize basic 
transportation. 
SADIE
Oh, so...you don’t even like cars? 
KATHERINE
You don’t need to “like” something to
sell it. I bet the guy who sells manure
doesn’t “like” shit. I bet he doesn’t
subscribe to Shit Magazine, and restore
classic shits with his friends. 
(then)
Sorry, you’re not one of those crazy car
people, are you?
SADIE
No, no, not really. I mean, define car
person, right? Do I appreciate cars?
Sure. Do I love cars? Define love. I
mean, define cars, for that matter--
KATHERINE
Who’s that?
SADIE
No idea. He looks like an assembly line
guy or something, maybe he’s lost.
(struggling to move on)
So if you want to come down to the test 
track later, we can take you through-- 
KATHERINE
Why’s he in your office? 
SADIE
Huh. Yeah. Weird. Let me go deal with... whoever the heck that is, and we will
continue this... on the B-side.
KATHERINE
“I found the car chassis in a bowl of
molasses.”
ELLIOT
...because you’re the one who was
responsible for a little disaster called
the Payne Python.
CYRUS
Me? You’re the one who said to design a
sports car with “a phallic look”!
ELLIOT
Phallic! Conveying the idea of phallicism.
Not a dildo on wheels!
CYRUS
It was not a dildo on wheels!
CYRUS (CONT’D)
Sadie, did the Python look like a dildo?
SADIE
(without stopping)
You could practically see the vein
running down the shaft. 
CYRUS
That was the exhaust pipe!
SADIE
Hey, you shouldn’t be up here. 
JACK
Sorry. I would’ve called, but the 
employee directory just had the same 
number for all the executives, so I 
figured that’s just like a general office 
number, unless you’re all roommates-- 
SADIE
Look, I’m sorry, last week was fun, but 
it was a mistake. 
JACK
Yeah, no, you told me-- 
SADIE
It’s nothing personal, you’re obviously 
extremely good looking, your biceps in 
particular-- 
JACK 
Thank you. 
SADIE 
It’s just, especially now that we have 
this new CEO, it would look really bad 
for me to be involved with a guy from the 
factory. Not just the factory, anyone who 
works at the company. We’d be having this 
same conversation if you were an 
accountant-- 
JACK 
Did you ask to have me transferred to the 
truck plant in Midland? 
SADIE 
Huh? No. Nope, uh-uh. 
JACK 
My supervisor said it came from up here. 
And I thought maybe if you were feeling 
weird about having me around after, you 
know, and you were trying to find a way 
to get rid of me... 
SADIE 
(pretending to remember)
Oh yeah, no, what happened was, we got a 
call saying they needed a day shift
operator up there, and I heard you’re the
best. 
JACK
Who’d you hear that from?
SADIE
...Everybody. Everybody’s saying it. But
it’s a good opportunity for you, right?
Big promotion. Big.
JACK
(skeptical)
Uh-huh.
SADIE
So, um, congratulations on this... step
forward in your career.
WESLEY 
Maybe I should’ve just taken the CEO job. 
DORI 
Did they offer it to you? 
WESLEY 
Well, not technically, but only because 
they already knew I’d say no. 
DORI 
Oh. So, how did they-- 
KATHERINE
Hey Dori, if anyone calls, I’ll be taking 
a look at the car prototype. 
DORI
Got it.
KATHERINE
Oh, and I need you to be in charge of
whatever A/V stuff we need for the press 
thing later, okay? 
DORI
(pouts)
Me? The most technology I know how to use
is my hair curler and my vibrator.
DORI (CONT’D)
(suddenly serious, professional)
But I will figure it out.
WESLEY 
If anything, I’m able to be more 
effective as a consultant, because a 
consultant wears so many hats. 
CYRUS
Ever since Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built
the first road vehicle in 1769, cars have
been driven by one thing: people. In
1808, François Isaac de--
KATHERINE
Press is coming in six hours, maybe we
could we do without the whole intro?
CYRUS
Got it, I’ll save these for another time.
SADIE
So how do I put this in drive?
CYRUS
It’s voice-controlled.
(to car)
“Oh Baby: Drive us around the block.”
SADIE
You’re calling it “Baby”?
ELLIOT
Bit misogynistic, don’t you think?
CYRUS
How is that misogynistic?
ELLIOT
You can’t call a woman “baby”.
CYRUS
It’s not a woman, it’s a car.
ELLIOT
Cars are always women. “She’s a beauty.”
“Let’s take her for a spin.”
CYRUS
Well this car’s a man, okay?!
KATHERINE
Figures -- first car that does the
driving, and it’s a man.
SADIE
Hey Cyrus, where’s the brake?
CYRUS
You don’t need one. Watch.
KATHERINE
Wow, that’s pretty neat.
CYRUS
(proudly)
Yeah, the car creates a map of its
environment by emitting rapid pulses of
laser light and then measuring the time
it takes for the light to reflect back...
WESLEY
You see our new overlord? “Katherine”.
Sounds like someone who uses a catheter.
JACK
Sick burn.
WESLEY
I bet she only got the job cause she’s a 
woman, which is like winning the friggin’ 
genital lottery these days. If things go 
bad, do I have your loyalty?
JACK
I just work here, man, I don’t really
want to get into a whole thing.
WESLEY
Well if you change your mind, a
resistance is forming. Ewell Payne would 
not have wanted that woman running his 
company.
JACK
Why, is she Jewish?
ELLIOT
Always mention fuel economy. Even if it’s
bad, most consumers never actually do the
math. They just assume a car is green
because it was mentioned at all.
SADIE
Cyrus? There’s someone...
CYRUS
Don’t worry, we’ll stop.
SADIE
Okay, but we’re not stopping.
KATHERINE
Turn the wheel.
SADIE
There is no wheel! 
CYRUS
You don’t need to do anything.
SADIE
Cyrus, stop the car! It’s not
stopping! Stop the car!
CYRUS (CONT'D)
It’s gonna stop, it’ll stop,
it’s gonna stop-- SHIT!
KATHERINE / SADIE / ELLIOT
STOP THE CAR! / BRAKE
BRAKE! / IT’S NOT STOPPING!
CYRUS (CONT'D)
BABY, STOP! BABY, BABY, STOP,
BABY, STOP!
ELLIOT
I’m sorry, “baby” is just really stupid.
I can’t get past that.
JACK
I’m fine. You didn’t hit me that hard.
KATHERINE
Are you sure we even hit you? It looked
like you might have fallen on your own
right before the car seemed to hit you.
ELLIOT
Yep, that’s the way it looked to me.
JACK
Don’t worry, I’m not gonna sue. 
KATHERINE
Ha ha ha, can we get that in writing? Ha,
I’m just kidding. But we could write it
down, though, just as a goof.
CYRUS
We think we know what caused the accident.
KATHERINE
Alleged accident.
SADIE
He may have fallen on his own in an
almost shockingly coincidental confluence
of events.
CYRUS
Okay, well, you know how I was saying the
car measures the time it takes for lasers
to reflect off objects? Well, darker
colors reflect less light, which is
tricking the sensors into thinking darker
objects are farther away than they
actually are.
SADIE
And by “darker objects”, you mean...?
CYRUS
Like a black cat, or a dark blue car, or...
(reluctant to say it)
Darker... brown... skin.
JACK
So you made a car that hits black people?
CYRUS
No! No! No! ... Not intentionally.
ELLIOT
What is wrong with you?!
WESLEY
What would Ewell Paine have said if he
saw we’d designed a car that runs over
black people?
SADIE
“Well done”, probably.
CYRUS
It doesn’t “run over black people”, it
just doesn’t see them as well. It would
hit Indian people too.
ELLIOT
Oh good, I was worried we’d designed a
car that wouldn’t hit Indian people.
KATHERINE
How are you only figuring this out now?
In the pharmaceutical industry, we would
test our products before announcing them.
WESLEY
Didn’t stop all those babies from being
born without heads.
KATHERINE
They had heads, they were just small.
CYRUS
We tested it! But the dummies we tested
it on were all white. I don’t think they
even make black crash test dummies!
JACK
Just when I thought we were so close to
the mountaintop.
SADIE
So can you fix it by this afternoon?
CYRUS
We have to completely overhaul the
mapping technology, it’ll take months.
SADIE
I’ll cancel the press conference.
KATHERINE
No, wait! It’s my first big press event. 
If we cancel at the last minute, the 
press is gonna ask questions, Wall 
Street’ll start getting nervous - it’s 
gonna look like I don’t know what I’m 
doing. 
WESLEY
(barely suppressing a smile)
Oh no, that’d be terrible. 
SADIE 
So you’d rather have your legacy as CEO 
be the introduction of the world’s first 
racist car? 
ELLIOT
Maybe we could just market it in Canada, 
where it’s less of an issue.
WESLEY
What if we painted it black?
CYRUS
How would that help?
WESLEY
Just seems like, optics-wise, a white car
that hits black people looks worse than a
black car that hits black people. 
KATHERINE 
The press doesn’t know it’s supposed to 
be a self-driving car, right? We could 
just take that part out of it. 
SADIE 
The invitation said it would be a
“revolution in transportation”. I’m not
sure a generic white car with no special
features qualifies as a revolution.
WESLEY
What about a generic black car with no
special features?
KATHERINE
Okay, then why don’t we come up with some 
special features. 
People react: “What?!” “How?!”
CYRUS
We can’t just design a whole new car in 
six hours.
KATHERINE
Well, maybe we won’t be able to come up
with anything as advanced as your
Klanmobile over there...
(Cyrus reacts)
But it’s hard for me to believe that this 
group of very highly-paid professionals 
can’t come up with a few ideas? Is that 
something you believe? 
ELLIOT 
That’s certainly not something I, for 
one, believe. 
CYRUS
But it’s not just thinking of an idea. I
don’t know how to weld a car together.
JACK
I do.
KATHERINE
Great, done!
SADIE
I’m not sure that’s a good idea. He
should go to the hospital.
KATHERINE
For what - tripping on his shoelaces? He
said he was fine, we all heard him say he
was fine, let it go!
WESLEY
Would the car also run over white people,
if they were in blackface?
CYRUS
Um... yeah, probably.
SADIE 
This is a nightmare! 
CYRUS
I know! It takes three years to design a 
car, minimum, and we’re supposed to do it
in the time it takes to binge watch
Russian Doll?
SADIE
I haven’t seen it.
CYRUS
So good.
SADIE
At least you’re not being forced to work 
on a task force with the new boss you’re 
trying to impress and the one guy in the 
company you just had sex with. 
CYRUS 
(considers her, then) 
Hot assembly line-guy? 
(Sadie nods, he’s impressed) 
Shut up! When?! 
SADIE 
Dan’s retirement party. I stopped by for 
one drink. 
(MORE)
But then I had a few more, and I start 
talking to this guy from the factory with 
this whole Bruce Springsteen vibe - like 
he literally had a baseball cap tucked 
into the back pocket of his jeans, why 
would you keep it there, it can’t be 
comfortable. 
CYRUS 
I think it’s a blue-collar thing. Their 
butts are harder so they don’t feel it. 
SADIE 
I’ve never flirted with anyone I work 
with, I’ve never had a one-night stand, 
and then I slip up one time, and I run 
over the guy with a car. Why couldn’t I 
just get HPV like a normal person? 
CYRUS 
Look, Katherine’s never gonna know. 
There’s like 15,000 people who work here. 
After today, she’ll probably never even 
see this guy again, much less have a 
conversation about which chicks from the 
14th floor he’s boned. 
SADIE 
I hope so. I’d like her to think of me as 
a competent professional, not some weird 
car-loving sex-crazed cougar who prowls 
the factory floor looking for a nice set 
of arms. 
CYRUS 
He does have nice arms. 
SADIE 
Holy god, it’s like someone stamped him 
out of sheet metal. 
KATHERINE
Okay, we need a feature that’s a
“revolution in transportation”, and we
have five-and-a-half hours to do it. Go!
(there’s silence)
Guys, there are no bad ideas. Tear up the 
old rule book. 
SADIE (CONT'D)
(MORE)
This is your chance to free your minds. 
This is your chance to dream! 
ELLIOT
(beat, then)
Maybe some kind of safety feature?
WESLEY
So boring!
DORI
(typing)
“Safety feature.”
CYRUS
You can’t just say safety feature. “The
all new Payne, featuring... a ‘safety 
feature’.”
ELLIOT
Okay, how ‘bout we give it two giant
testicles at the base, does that work
better for you?
CYRUS
The Python didn’t look like a dildo!
WESLEY
Motor Trend called it “Payne's Boner”.
And given that my last name is Payne, it
felt like they were talking about my
boner. And I don't like the media
commenting on my boners.
SADIE
Then don’t wear those pants to the press
conference.
KATHERINE
Maybe we should step back and start with
figuring out what people want. What do
people like?
DORI
(reading off computer)
Online it says the top things people like
are Game of Thrones, The Beatles,
puppies, pornography, Jesus Christ,
Netflix, and Ellen DeGeneres.
JACK
I think we cracked it.
ELLIOT
It doesn’t matter what we want, the
biggest emerging market is China. What
does the Chinese driver want?
WESLEY
Chopstick holder.
(explaining)
In China, they use chopsticks instead of
forks.
SADIE
But American cars don’t have fork holders.
JACK 
Anything can be a fork holder, if you put
a fork in it.
WESLEY 
Exactly, thank you! 
KATHERINE
I mean, what do people like about
driving? I truly don’t get it.
CYRUS
You don’t like cars?
KATHERINE
They’re fine. Sometimes I’ll be in a
place, and I’ll want to go to another
place, and cars help me do that.
WESLEY
Boom, fork holder. Boom, fork holder.
Stick it in my pocket, now my pocket’s a
fork holder.
CYRUS
Cars are where form meets function. Name
one other thing that’s utilitarian while
at the same time a fashion accessory, a
status symbol, and a work of art.
KATHLEEN
I don’t know, a wristwatch?
CYRUS
...Uh-huh. That would be another one.
DORI
It’s about freedom. When you have a car,
you can go anywhere you want. Nothing is
off-limits.
SADIE
You’ve literally never left Detroit in
your entire life.
DORI
Why would I want to leave Detroit? 
WESLEY
For me, it’s genetic. Cars are in my 
blood. So is hemophilia, unfortunately.
Several of my ancestors married cousins
in order to keep the family fortune
intact.
ELLIOT
It’s about identity. Tell me what someone
drives, and I can tell you 37 distinct
personality traits about them.
CYRUS
That is so not true.
ELLIOT
Spoken like a true BMW 6-series.
JACK
Cars are just fun. They go fast, they’re
cool. I don’t get why anyone would ever 
want a self-driving car. Driving’s not a
means to an end, driving is the end.
KATHERINE
Whoa, someone’s a little cuckoo for carnuts.
SADIE
I know, right? Let’s all just relax,
they’re cars, they’re not that big a deal.
JACK
Okay says the lady with Ferraris all over
her bedsheets and a shower head shaped
like a fuel nozzle--
SADIE
(eyes widening)
Shut up, shut up, shut up!! 
KATHERINE
How do you know what her shower head
looks like?
JACK
(realizing he overshared)
Um...
DORI
Looks like someone’s been taking her work
home with her.
ELLIOT
Anyone here order a “lube job”?
WESLEY
“Sexy Sadie” - that’s your new nickname!
Boom!
CYRUS
Back to the car: what if instead of a new
feature, we just did something new to the
look of it?
KATHERINE
Do we have time for that?
CYRUS
We don’t have time for any of this! But
maybe we could make a tiny tweak or two,
as long as we don’t go too crazy.
WESLEY
Let’s make it into a dragon!!
CYRUS
What?! We can’t just--
ELLIOT
Dragons are very big right now.
WESLEY
Right? We could give it those doors that
open upwards like wings. And then the
headlights could be like eyes, and we
could put horns on the roof.
CYRUS
We’re designing a car, not a parade float!
DORI
It could breathe fire out of the exhaust
pipe.
CYRUS
The exhaust pipe’s in the rear. So it
would be farting fire.
DORI
Well, we don’t know what end the fire
actually came out of, historically.
JACK
So... this is what you guys do up here 
all day. I always wondered.
JACK (CONT’D)
Yeah, um... in retrospect, I think 
talking about what your bedsheets looked
like might have been a mistake. 
SADIE
Now that you say it, it wasn’t ideal. 
JACK
I’m really sorry about that.
SADIE
S’okay.
KATHERINE
Maybe write up a press release, in the
event that we might have to cancel.
SADIE
(re: computer)
Already on it.
KATHERINE
I’m not saying we will. But... it’s not
looking great.
DORI
Guys, don’t you think pocket doors would
be cool, for tight parking spaces?
CYRUS
We’re not designing a bedroom closet, no
one wants a car with pocket doors.
JACK
Except the ‘54 Kaiser Darrin.
SADIE
There’s the ‘54 Kaiser Darrin.
SADIE (CONT’D)
I don’t even know how I knew that, I
think I read it on a popsicle stick--
KATHERINE
I get it, you love cars.
JACK
Actually, if it were me, I’d go with the
scissor doors off a Lamborghini Gallardo.
SADIE
Yeah, those are cool. They’d look good
with the spoiler from a McLaren P1.
JACK
And the headlamps from a Bugatti Chiron.
SADIE
The grille from an Alfa Romeo Giulia.
JACK
That would be a beautiful car.
SADIE
Yeah it would.
ELLIOT
Is this, like, foreplay?
SADIE
What? No!
JACK
Come on, dude!
DORI
I feel like I’m watching Moonlighting
right now.
CYRUS
Guys, we need to figure out what to do
with what we have. We don’t have access
to some giant reservoir of parts to make
a dream car.
KATHERINE
Don’t we?
SADIE
We can’t possibly be allowed to do this.
ELLIOT
It’s fine. We’re tearing up the rule
book! 
KATHERINE
No, this is a crime, we’ve gotta move
quick before someone sees us.
KATHERINE
So is there a screw someplace, or like a
bolt, or...?
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
...Okay.
ELLIOT
Need any help?
JACK
Yeah. Would you hand me the angle
grinder?
DORI
“Connect the 3G-SDI cable to the HDMI
Port 1.2 Input.” Okay...
WESLEY
Ooh, this is cool.
CYRUS
Dude, don’t take their dry-cleaning.
WESLEY
(defensive)
I wasn’t, I’m just looking.
FLUMMOXED EMPLOYEE
What are you doing?
KATHERINE
I’m taking your hubcaps.
(then, off his reaction)
It’s okay, I’m the CEO.
DORI
Patty, does your grandson still sell
ecstasy at raves?
(then)
Oh good. I need the phone number of
whoever’s in charge of the laser
projectors there.
SADIE
Hey!
JACK
Oops, sorry.
SADIE
Slippery suckers.
WESLEY
I’ve been asked to introduce our new
female CEO to you. At York 
Pharmaceuticals, Katherine Hastings was 
responsible for record profits. As well 
as record class action lawsuits and
record fines from the FDA. I’m kidding.
But it’s true - look it up. 
JOURNALIST
Were you the one who designed the Python?
CYRUS
(sighs, annoyed)
I was told to design something phallic--
JOURNALIST
I loved the styling. The lines, the form -
I wrote a great review about it.
CYRUS
Thank you. Not everyone understood it.
What do you write for?
JOURNALIST
EroticaMaleFetish.com.
CYRUS
So we just let any blogger into these
things now?
ELLIOT
(re: phone)
Oh, this is extremely graphic.
DORI
Now it says “choose a de-gamma curve”,
but I don’t know what that is.
(beat, then)
I’m sorry, it’s hard to hear you over the
bass music.
SADIE
How much longer?
JACK
I can’t hold the rocker panel flush with
the quarter panel long enough to bolt it.
SADIE
Here, what do you need?
JACK
Just hold this here... That’s
right... Now let me just...
SADIE (CONT'D)
This?... Okay, I’ve got it...
SADIE (CONT’D)
How’s that?
JACK
Perfect.
KATHERINE
Is it ready?
SADIE
(blurts)
Nothing!
KATHERINE
Huh?
JACK
We just need a few more minutes.
KATHERINE
(sighs)
Okay, I’ll stall. But hurry up.
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Oh, it should go without saying, but
don’t bang in here, okay?
SADIE
No, I wouldn’t--
JACK
We weren’t going--
KATHERINE
You can bang in here later, if you want.
Just, we’re really short on time, so
don’t bang now. Thanks.
WESLEY
Now a number of you might be wondering:
why did the board put this woman in
charge, when Paynes have been leading
Payne Motors so successfully for over a
hundred years?
(then)
Thank you.
KATHERINE
Thank you. I am so so, so excited to be
here at Payne Motors. Because... I love
cars. All types of cars. Two-doors. Fourdoors. SUVs. Convertibles. Big cars.
Small cars...
WESLEY
Not a natural speaker, is she?
SADIE
C’mon, we’ve gotta go!
JACK
I don’t even know what this means.
SADIE
It’s good enough. Let’s go.
KATHERINE
I love them when they’re old. I love them
when they’re new. I love them when
they’re red, I love them when they’re
blue...
(realizing)
That might have been Dr. Seuss.
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
I could go on and on. But that’s not what 
you came here for. So ladies and 
gentlemen, I give you: this! 
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
So, uh, Cyrus, can you help explain your 
vision to everyone? 
CYRUS 
Mm-mm. 
KATHERINE
No? Okay. Maybe Sadie, could you...?
SADIE
Yes, so, this was inspired by the... 
platypus, which is a beautiful and, uh, 
regal creature - I think it’s endangered, 
maybe. And while the different parts of 
the car may seem like they don’t go 
together, that’s the point. Because... 
what we all love about cars is different. 
As she speaks, she glances around at our other characters, 
calling back their discussion. 
SADIE (CONT’D) 
For some of us, they’re just 
transportation. For others, they’re art. 
Or self-expression. Or freedom. Or 
they’re just really f-ing fun. 
KATHERINE 
Which is why we designed the first fully 
modular, customizable vehicle. You choose 
the parts and you plug them into the 
(mispronounces, throat-clearing) 
chassis yourself. It’s up to you. Ladies 
and gentlemen, on behalf of Payne Motors: 
welcome to the revolution! 

REPORTER
So you’re saying the “revolution in
transportation” is just... whatever
people want? 
KATHERINE
Well, I’ve only been here six weeks, this 
was a concept I inherited from the
previous administration. I’m not a fan of 
it either, we probably won’t even do it.
Anyway, thank you all for coming.
FLUMMOXED EMPLOYEE
Baby, I need you to come pick me up.
ELLIOT
Well, the good news is, we got a lot of
press attention.
WESLEY
(starting a chant)
Re-sign, re-sign, re-sign. I’m just
kidding.
KATHERINE
Maybe I’m rationalizing, but I thought
that went pretty well.
SADIE
Really? What would it have looked like if
it’d gone poorly?
KATHERINE
Look, if everyone had loved it, there’d
be nowhere to go but down. In Pharma, we
had an expression: You don’t start with
boner pills. You start with hypertension,
and then work your way up to boners.
ELLIOT
That’s a beautiful sentiment.
CYRUS
Well, the next car I design will be a
whole lot better.
KATHERINE
(in all seriousness)
It better.
SADIE
Excuse me.
DORI
Better not let me drink too much. Who
knows what a gal might do?
JACK
Hey.
SADIE
Hey. What’s in the box?
JACK
I just cleaned out my locker. Do you want 
a Dale Earnhardt Funko Pop? 
SADIE
(considers him, then) 
You don’t have to do that.
JACK
It’s fine, I have three of them. 
SADIE
I mean, don’t go to the Midland plant. If
you don’t want to. You should stay.
JACK
(smiles)
Scared you’d miss me?
SADIE
Please. There’s like 15,000 people who
work here. How often would we even ever
see each other? Like, barely...
JACK
Hey. Which desk should I take?
KATHERINE
Oh, whatever’s open.
SADIE
Wait, what? What’s happening?
KATHERINE
I’m bumping Jack up to the 14th floor.
Feels like we could use a bit of bluecollar perspective around this place. And
I believe in rewarding loyalty.
(to Jack)
Speaking of loyalty...
JACK
(hands her signed form)
I was never hit by a car. I wasn’t even
there at the time that the car didn’t hit
me.
KATHERINE
Thank you.
KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Oh, that’s my Uber.
(then, explaining)
I don’t know how to drive.

JACK
Maybe a little more often than once a 
year. This is gonna be fun.
