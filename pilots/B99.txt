We start CLOSE on DET. JAKE PERALTA (Andy Samberg).
JAKE
I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat. I'm not becoming like 
them... I am them.
AMY (O.S.)
What are you doing, weirdo?
Reveal Jake was speaking into a VIDEO CAMERA, that's attached to TEN TV MONITORS -- all filled with 
his image. DET. AMY SANTIAGO (Melissa Fumero) watches, annoyed.
JAKE
I'm doing the best speech from "Donnie Brasco." Actually--
(points to monitors)
--ten of me are doing the best speech from "Donnie Brasco."
(then, on all ten monitors) ’Sup?
AMY
Get it together, man. All ten of you.
Jake starts playing with all the electronic equipment. Amy reviews her notes with the owner, AHMED.
AMY (CONT’D)
Store was hit about two hours ago. Perps disabled the alarm--
A DRUM MACHINE goes off LOUDLY.
JAKE
Sorry! My bad.
AMY
They mostly took tablets and cameras.

I'd like a list of your employees, anyone who had access to the store. I'd also like to apologize 
for my partner. His parents didn't give him enough attention.
MUSIC STARTS from the karaoke machine, and Jake starts singing to "Believe" by Cher.
JAKE (O.S.)
DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIFE AFTER LOVED --
AMY
Dude, seriously?
JAKE
I know, not my first choice either, but it's stuck. Got any other songs, Ahmed7
AHMED
No, is broken. You want it? One-fifty for you. Works perfect.
JAKE
You literally just said it was broken. (singing)
I THINK THIS ROBB-RY WAS A SMASH AND GRAB
/ I REALLY BELIEVE IT WAS A SMASH AND GRAB, OH!!!
AMY
Really, Cher? I think it was an inside job. Prove me wrong.
JAKE
A challenge? Is this a challenge? I love challenges!
(putting down the mic)
The door and the register were both forced, and they tripped a motion sensor
-- i.e., not an inside job.
AMY
Or it's an inside job meant to look like a smash and grab.
JAKE
Sorry. We're looking for three white males, one of whom has tatt sleeves on both arms.

AMY
And how do you know that, dare I ask7

Ugh. You got lucky.
JAKE
You know what they say: Luck is 95% talent, 5% being awesome.
AMY
No one's ever said that.
JAKE

Whelp... we did it, Fuzzy. We got ’em. You can come home now.

SGT. TERRY JEFFORDS (Terry Crews) stands in front of a roomful of detectives: Jake, Amy, ROSA 
(Stephanie Beatriz), and CHARLES (Joe Lo Truglio), and the civilian administrator GINA (Chelsea 
Peretti). All of them continue to chatter.
TERRY
Quiet, please. Come on, guys, I don't want to have to raise my voice. Rosa?
ROSA
(super loud) Shut up!
Everyone shuts up.
TERRY
Thank you, Rosa. First off, Gina has some administrative announcements.
GINA
Thank you. Thank you. No need to applaud. First of all, starting today there's a new claim form for 
"lost equipment." Sadly, I have misplaced it.
Everybody CHUCKLES, including Gina.
GINA (CONT'D)
But seriously, I do not know where I put those forms. If you see them, let me know. Also, my dance 
troupe,
"Floor-gasm," is performing at the Atlantic Antic on Sunday. Please come watch me dance, unless you 
are an old pervert.
She points to SCULLY, who is DIRECTLY in front of her.
TERRY
Thank you, Gina. Open cases -- you closed the electronics store robbery from last week?

JAKE
I will!
TERRY
JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?
JAKE
Early this morning, someone decided to shoot and kill luxury food importer Harry Morgenthau. Body 
was discovered by his cleaning lady.
He clicks to a photo of a WOMAN.
JAKE (CONT'D)
During her interview, using expert detective work, I deduced that she had something super gross on 
her chin. I took a picture of it, as evidence.
Close up picture of the woman's chin, covered in gunk.
CHARLES
I think it was flan.
JAKE
Charles thinks it was flan. I think it was butterscotch pudding.
ROSA
Maybe it was just, like, that old person gunk. You know the way they're always covered in gunk? 
Oldies are gross.
Everyone nods.
TERRY
How about we focus on the murder, instead of the old person gunk?

ROSA
Tell us about this new captain. You worked with him before, right?
TERRY
Years ago. Captain Holt will be here soon. He'll want to introduce himself.
AMY
Well, as soon as he's settled in, I have a presentation for him.
(pulls out folder)
Crime-stat analysis for the precinct, and some strategy proposals.
JAKE
Oh, are you hoping to be put in charge of the Brown Noser Squad, Sergeant Asskisser?

CHARLES
Yeah, then maybe one day you can be Lieutenant Asskisser, on the Brown Noser Squad.

JAKE
That's exactly what I said.
CHARLES
Great minds, rights

GINA
That you're wasting your time. She's got a type, which is: anyone but you.
CHARLES
Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type, too.
Charles looks sad. Gina takes pity on him.
GINA
A Rihanna concert is a pretty big swing, man. She's into watching old movies.
Maybe start there.
CHARLES
Cool. Where... would I find a place that shows old movies?
GINA
Just go on the internet and search for the phrase "I want to buy two movie tickets for a girl who 
doesn't like me."
CHARLES
...I don't even need to add the zip code, or something?

Just got these crime scene photos -- look at the victim's socks.
AMY

JAKE
No, just -- they're super nice socks, right? Where do you get socks like that? I have the worst

Jake stares at him. Decides not to back down.
JAKE
Well, lemme see... "washed-up pencil- pusher"... “forgotten how to be a cop“... I think I was done, 
actually.
HOLT
Okay. Now do the robot voice. (off Jake's look)
The robot voice you were doing when you implied I'm a rule-following robot. I want to hear it 
again.
JAKE
...”Meep morp... zeep... robot...”
HOLT
That's a terrible robot voice. And the next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie.
JAKE
Our old captain didn't care if we wore ties.

HOLT
Well, your new captain does. And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders.

Mustang, pretty sweet. If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him.
HOLT
Just one date?
GINA
He guarantees it'll end in sex. She says it won't. I don't know, though, Jake's got some moves. I'd

Are we just naming positive things? Rainbows. Kittens. Thanksgiving dinner!
HOLT
Hmm. Four highly-trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery. I want to be 
briefed on any new angles. Any questions?
JAKE
Well, I was curious whether you thought I was doing too much man-scaping, and apparently you do, so 
I'm good.
Holt, Rosa, and Amy drift away. Jake turns to Charles.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Hey, what about that expensive jamon iber-crap stuffs The perp left a really expensive TV behind, 
but stole ham? Is there a place near the crime scene that sells it?

CHARLES
Beneficio's might. Their cured meats section is ridiculous. Though, I mainly think of it as a 
gelato place--
JAKE
Stop talking. Let's go.
As they head out...
CHARLES
You gotta brief the C.O. first.
JAKE
We'll brief him after we catch the guy.
24  INT. BENEFICIO'S LUXURY MARKET - LATER          24
Jake and Charles enter the market. They talk to RATKO, a HULKING SERBIAN BUTCHER, who is very 
nervous.

Do you recognize him? Henry Morgenthau7
RATKO
No.
JAKE
(smiling)
Look at the picture first, maybe, Ratko.
RATKO
I tell you. I don't know him. I don't know what happened. No more questions!
JAKE
Okay, I'll tell you what happened. He came by and said he had some hams to sell. You knew they were 
worth a lot of money, so you tried to rob him when he wasn't home. Only he was home, and he fought 
back, so you shot him. Am I close? Nod your giant caveman head and drool if I'm close.
Ratko pushes over a display of Italian tuna and runs.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Oh man, I hate running! (yelling)
Ratko stop! Stop Ratko!
Ratko starts THROWING BOTTLES at them -- Jake gets pegged in the chest by a bottle of JAM.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Ow! Ratko, I'm getting mad.
Another bottle of jam smashes on the floor. Charles HOWLS.
CHARLES
That's thirty dollar marmalade!
Jake sneaks down the aisle with gun drawn.
RATKO (O.S.)
I not mean to kill. It not my fault.

Okay. Okay. I believe you. Be cool.

As soon as he gets to the end of the aisle, a GIANT LEG OF LAMB crashes down on his arm, causing 
him to drop his gun. Ratko pushes him into a display of OLIVES and TAKES OFF.

Jake rounds a corner. Ratko is SMOOSHING Charles's head into a TUB of GELATO. Ratko runs off. 
Charles's face is covered in gelato. He tastes it.
CHARLES
It really is the best gelato in the city.
25  INT. HOLT'S OFFICE - LATER               25
Jake and Charles sit, exhausted and covered in food. Terry and Holt are there.
TERRY
What the hell happened? And what's on your face?
CHARLES
Passion fruit sorbet.
JAKE
Good news is: we found the murderer. Ratko Slovic, a Serbian butcher. Robbery gone bad. He 
confessed and everything.
HOLT
I don't see a Serbian butcher in here, so I assume there's bad news.
JAKE
Charles and I may have allowed Ratko to escape. But, one more piece of good news:
Jake holds up a small cup of gelato with a small spoon in it.

Terry, Amy, and Jake. The room overflows with files.
JAKE
He's seriously assigning me to the records room? Why do we even have a records room? The computer 
has been invented, right?
TERRY
You're lucky, man. I wish I could get assigned here full time.
(lovingly)
You could not be farther from the action.
JAKE
Sergeant, you know me. I have more arrests than anyone. Can you please tell the captain how dumb it 
is to lock his best detective in a file cabinet?
AMY
Second best.
TERRY
You're wrong about Holt. That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you'll ever know. In 
1981, he caught the Disco Strangler.

Rosa walks up to Charles’ desk.
ROSA
So? What movie did you get tickets to?
CHARLES
Well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them.
ROSA
"Just to be safe?" What does that mean?
CHARLES
I don't know. I didn't want to mess up, because you're sort of.  opinionated.
ROSA
You think I'm opinionated? Okay, here's an opinion for you: you're a bad judge of character and 
your shirt looks like vomit.

CHARLES

ROSA
We are not seeing a movie together.
CHARLES
Sounds good.

I was skeptical, but it really did make a difference in my work. I think I found something

Here, let me show you.
Jake gets up and grabs a file. He's not wearing any PANTS, just a LIME GREEN SPEEDO. Holt waits a 
beat.
HOLT
I'm glad you've made progress in the case. Let's have you brief the team.
Holt grabs Jake's pants and heads towards the bullpen.
JAKE

31  INT. BRIEFING ROOM - LATER               31
The room is packed to the gills. Jake, still in his SPEEDO, stands in front. He hides his crotch 
with the FILE.
JAKE
Yes. Well. Thank you all for coming. Including -- oh! -- Craig, our crime scene photographer.
A MAN snaps a PHOTO of Jake.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Great. So. After being unfairly tossed into the records room for no reason, I got so bored I 
started reading some old cases.

HOLT
A novel idea.
JAKE
"Ratko" was a made-up name, but: after looking through a million files, one of which I literally 
found in a spiderweb, I found a bunch of references to a Serbian thug, street names: "The Rat" and 
"The Butcher." Suspect in a few break-ins -- used to hang out at a storage unit near Boerum 
Park...which has red soil, hence the muddy red footprints on Monganthau's counter. Also, I am 
freezing. Can I put my pants on now?

Jake leans forward.

Well, I for one am very excited to be on a stakeout with you, Captain. You know what my fave part 
of stakeouts is?
Patrol guide says: casual dress.
HOLT
Does he always talk this much?
AMY
I just tune it out. It's like a white noise machine.
JAKE
First off, that's racist. Second of all, you caught the Disco Strangler, right?
That dude wrapped a lot of yo-yos around a lot of hookers' necks. Nice collar.
But the thing I can't understand is: young superstar detective takes down a serial killer... why'd 
it take you so long to get your first command?
HOLT
Because I'm gay.
Jake LAUGHS. Holt does not. He sits there, placidly. Slowly, Jake realizes...
JAKE

HOLT
I'm surprised you didn't know. I don't try to hide it.

HOLT
I know, Peralta. You're a lot of things, but you're not a homophobe.
AMY
When did you come out?
HOLT
About twenty-five years ago. The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay detective. Then the old guard 
died, and suddenly, they couldn't wait to show off the fact that they had a high-ranking gay 
officer. I made captain, but they put me into a public affairs unit. I was a good soldier, helped 
recruitment... but all I ever wanted was a command.

But also, look, there's Ratko. Humility over. I'm amazing.

RATKO
You can't stop me. I'm going.
JAKE
You're not going, actually. Because if you'll just take a quick peek to your right, you'll see 
Detectives Boyle and Diaz.
Ratko looks: Charles and Rosa, guns drawn, are to his right.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Over there is Detective Santiago. And behind you is Captain Holt. Can you believe that? A captain, 
on a stakeout! He's kind of a hands-on dude. Point is, we have you surrounded --

It's a uniform. We're a team, and ties are part of the uniform for that team. Right.

RATKO

No, Ratko, shut up. It's important to you because you were kept off that team, and now you're the
