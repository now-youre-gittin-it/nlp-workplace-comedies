J.D (V.0.)
Since I was eleven years old, I've been
able to sleep through anything. Storms,
earthquakes, my girlfriend yelling at me
to "Open the door or we're through, you
name it.

J.D (V.0.)
Last night I didn't sleep.

I guess I get a little goofy when I'm
nervous.
You see, today isn't just any other day..
It's my first day.
I'm the man.
J.D (V.0.)
And four years of pre-med, four years of
med school, and hundreds of thousands of
dollars in unpaid loans have finally made
me realize one important thing... ..
NURSE KEARNEY
Good, could you go drop aN.G. tube on
the patient in 234 and call the attending
if the lavage is positive?
J.D.
Sure.
J.D (V.O.)
I don't know jack.
So, this is my story...
J.D
I'm supposed to be up in intensive care-
NURSE KEARNEY
Good. We just turfed him there.
We transferred him to I.C.U.
J.D.
Was this before you turfed him?
NURSE KEARNEY
That's what turfing means.
J.D.
I know that. I'm just having some fun
with you. Woo-hoo...

J.D (V.0.)
Look, I got into medicine because I always
wanted to help people, but orientation
yesterday didn't really focus on patient
care...
LAWYER
The hospital doesn't want to be sued, you
don't want to. be sued - let's be honest,
no one likes being sued. Being sued is
not a good thing...
J.D.
Turk, You know how I'm totally down with
the rap music...
TURK
Dude, be whiter.
J.D (V.0.) *
Chris Turk is my best friend. We *
roomed together in college. *
We roomed together in med school. *
*
J.D (V.0.) *
Hell, we even got accepted by the *
same hospital. *
J.D.
Here's the thing. Tupac, DMX, Dr. Dre-
in most of their songs, these artists use
an extremely volatile word--
TURK
Nigger. Yes, I am aware of that.

J.D.
My question is this. If we're both singing
aiong, and knowing that otherwise I'd
never use the word, am I allowed to say--
TURK
No.
J.D.
But what if-
TURK
Nooo.
J.D.
See, that's good to know.
LAWYER
Finally Doctors, if you make a mistake,
call me. Please, don't admit it to the
patient, or the patient's family
especially if there is a death involved.
Of course; if the patient is deceased,
you can feel free to tell him or her
anything.
J.D.
So, hey, I found us an apartment -
DR. KELSO
Listen up gang, I'm Dr. Bob Kelso, and
I'm your chief of medicine. We've got
some exciting times ahead, gang, so I
want you to think of me as your safety
net, because I promise you, we are a family
likehere. Now, I bought pizza in case you'd
to stick around and touch base with
your fellow interns. Go get 'em, doctors.
J.D.
Can I sing black magic woman?

TURK
You can hum it.

So the surgical interns are gonna go grab
a beer.
J.D.
The medical interns are having a Pac-Man
tournament. Apparently we're all twelve.
ELLIOT (0.S.)
I love Pac-Man.
J.D.
Me too. I love playing it, I love watching
it played. I just love it.
ELLIOT
I'm Elliot.
TURK
ELLIOT
Yeah, don't do that.
J.D.
I'm J.D., this is Turk.
TURK
So, Elliot... you medical or surgery?
ELLIOT
Medical.
AS TURK REACTS and WE HEAR A PAC-MAN DIE:
ELLIOT
So every male in my family is a doctor.
My dad, my granddad, my brother. Guess
that's why Dad gave me a guy's name, made
me play sports, date girls, I'm joking.

J.D.
I know, I would've laughed if you had
paused.
ELLIOT
Good. It was funny. So, Turk's cute.
J.D
(V.0.)
If she likes Turk, so be it.
J.D.
He's getting married.
ELLIOT
Anyway, I got better board scores than
Gramps, my dad, and my stupid brother...I
know what you're thinking.
J.D (V.O.)
Your butt looks like two pringles next to
each other.
J.D:
No you don't.

ELLIOT
The whole
Miss having-to-be-the-best thing,
"Hyper competitive, I mean it used
to be a big problem for me, used to... past 
tense.
J.D.
Hey. Are we racing?

ELLIOT
Yes.

ELLIOT
So, you do a lot of cardio?

JEFFERY
Reid and John Dorian?

Great. One, I am your resident, Dr.
Jeffery Steadman, not Jeff. Two, here
are your Manuals...
These can answer any basic questions you
have so don't bother me, ever, Kay? Three,
don't be a moron and open your manual
in up
front of a patient, Four...
J.D. (V.O.)
You ever notice how quickly some people
make an impression?
JEFFERY.
I'm a tool, I'm a tool. I'm a tool, tool, *
tool, tool, unbelievably annoying tool. *
J.D.
Yeah.
JEFFERY
Finally, these are your beepers. From
now on, these control your life, kay?
J.D.
Sorry, gotta go.
J.D.
I was beeped...
CARLA
Aww, first day Bambi? Carla will take
care of you - don't look at me when we're
moving someone.
CARLA
We're waiting for Dr. Cox...
J.D.
Hi, Dr., I'm--
DR. COX
Place an I.V. for me.
J.D.
We'll talk later.
DR. COX
Carla, a personal question. Do you spray
your perfume on or do you keep a tub full
of the crap and slosh around in it?
CARLA
I smell nice.

J.D (V.O.)
C'mon, you've done this to cadavers before.
So this guy's alive, just poke it through
his skin, poke it through - Now!

DR. COX
Time's up. Do that for him, please. I'm
also gonna need to get an ABG.
J.D.
Why are you telling her?
DR. COX
Shut up and watch.
CARLA
Awwww, be nice to Bambi.
DR. COX
This gomer has got to stop trying to die
while I'm eating lunch.
J.D..

That's a little insensitive.

J.D (V.0.)
Mistake.
DR. COX
This man is ninety-two, and has full
dementia. He doesn't even know we're
here. For Christ sake, he's inches away
from Carla's rack and he hasn't even
flinched.
That's so sweet.
J.D.
What about his subconscious?
DR. COX

Eisenhower was a sissy.
By the grace of God, I think we're gonna
be okay.
From now on, when I'm in the room, you're
not allowed to talk.
DR. KELSO
Now, Mr. Dorian, can you tell me what
ailment...
J.D (V.0.)
I'm gonna love rounds. The constant
questions, it's like being on a gameshow.

J.D.
What is uremia?
DR. KELSO
That's my boy.
J.D.
Uremia may lead to a symmetric sensorimotor
polyneuropathy that tends to affect the
lower limbs more than upper limbs, and is
more marked aistally than proximally...
DR. KELSO
Whoa, sport. Who stuck a quarter in you?
Nice, clean job with the foley catheter.
I J.D (V.O.)
had a nurse do it.
J.D.
Thank you, sir.
J.D (V.0.)
Unfortunately, I'm still afraid to touch
anybody.
I'd been thinking a lot about Elliot.
She's an anal-retentive, crazy,
smartypants, but in kind of a sexy way,
you know?
DR. KELSO
Dr. Reid, you're late.
ELLIOT
I got puked on, and seeing as it was
already the fifth time today, I needed to
cry for a few minutes.
DR. KELSO
Nothing wrong with squirting out a few.
You're off the hook if you can tell me
what to look out for in a uremic patient.

J.D (V.0.)
Anyway, I decided to go for it.
J.D.
Infection.
ELLIOT
Infection?
DR. KELSO
That's my girl. Moving on...
ELLIOT
I knew the answer.
J.D.
I'm sure you did.
ELLIOT
I was just frazzled--
J.D.
How could you net be?
ELLIOT
You know, with the--
J.D.
know.
ELLIOT
Good. But thanks, if I can ever do
anything for you--
J.D.
You could let your hair down again.
ELLIOT
Can I wash the puke out first?
J.D.
If you want.
ELLIOT
We'll see.
BOY.
Daddy, why did you marry Mommy?
J.D.
Well Tiger, I gave her an answer during
rounds and she immediately had sex with
me.

ELLIOT
(with sitcom smile)
Now go do your homework so I can continue
to satisfy your father sexually while
never questioning his authority.

DR. COX
What the hell are you doing?

DR. COX
Did you actually page me to ask how much
tylenol to give Mrs. Lenzer?
J.D.
I was worried that it could exacerbate
the patient's
DR. COX
It's regular strength tylenol! Have her
open her mouth, throw a handful at her,
and whatever lands in there is the correct
dosage.
J.D.
But-- 
DR. COX
And by no means are you to compromise our
no talking agreement.
J.D.
Dr. Cox, if you could give me any advice--
JDR. COX
Try not to kill anyone.
J.D.
Uh-huh. Dr. Kelso tells us all to stay
positive.
DR. COX
Look, I'm going to be careful because I
don't want to overstate this: Dr. Kelso
is the most evil human being on the face
of the earth and may actually be the devil
himself.
J.D.
Super.
It's just that this isn't what I
expected.Labs and tests 
and charts - it's all scut
work. Plus most of my patients are...
Older and kind of checked out mentally...
DR. COX
Pumpkin, that's modern medicine.
Bureaucratic nightmares, paperwork out
the ass, and advances
that keep people who should have died
years ago alive,
when they lost what made them
people. Your 
job is to stay sane enough so that
when someone comes in that
you can actually
help, 
you're not too braindead to
function, what!?!
J.D.
Do you think we should talk about this in
front of--
DR. COX
Her? She's dead. Write this down, Newbie.
You push around a stiff, nobody asks
to you
do anything.
J.D.
Thanks, you've been like a father to me.
DR. COX
Fine, you want some real advice?
They find out that
you're making nurses do all
your procedures they'll throw you out on
your ass so quick it'll make you dizzy.
J.D (V.0.)
And there it is.
DR. COX
Have a terrific day.

OLD WOMAN
Stop staring at me.
CARLA
Okay Bambi, here's Mrs. Lenzer's tox
screen, Mr. Hobert's blood work...
J.D (V.0.)
I couldn't help wondering if Turk is having
the same experience I am.
TURK
I'm such a stud.
J.D (V.O.)
Probably not.
TURK
This morning, I had my hands inside a
guy's chest. All the way inside; I
couldn't even see them.. I shouldn't be
allowed to do that.
J.D.
And you weren't scared?
TURK
What's there to be scared of? You know
what the attending said: "One way or
another, everyone stops bleeding".
That's deep man.
CARLA
No. it's not.
TURK
It's a little deep.
J.D.
So, hey, we never finished before. I
have to tell you about our apartment-

TODD
T-man!
TURK
J.D., Todd.
J.D.
Hey, how're you do--
J.D.
Can I talk to you?

And like that, I was back in high school.
You see, surgical interns, they're all
slice 'em and dice 'em. They're the
Medical interns jocks.
- we're trained to think
about the body. Diagnose, test, keep
everything on a little notecard. The
medical interns, well...
TODD
You've got a stain.
J.D (V.0.)
We're the chess club.
J.D.
I'm waiting for someone.
JANITOR
Door's broke. Every fifth time or so it
don't open.
J.D.
Maybe there's a penny stuck in there.
JANITOR
Why a penny?
J.D.
I don't know...
JANITOR
Did you stick a penny in there?
J.D.
I was just making small talk.
JANITOR
If I find a penny, I'm taking you down.
ELLIOT
Oh my God being on call sucks. You're
all alone, all night - it's terrifying,
you know?
J.D.
The janitor wants to kill me.
ELLIOT
Anyway, about eleven hours into being on call
last night, my twentieth admission
was this young girl who was throwing up
blood, and.. I actually wished it was
me.
J.D.
You know, I'll bet he's killed before.
ELLIOT
Seriously, I'd gladly be that sick to
lie in 
bed, watch TV, get to eat hospital
pudding, right? Right?
J.D.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, blood for pudding. You.
know, we're both off Monday night, so
maybe, you know, if you're not. busy, I
don't know, maybe we could--.
ELLIOT
I like Italian food, the movie
we're seeing starts 
at 9, so we'll eat at 7:30, and
please don't wear those shoes.

J.D (V.0.}
See? She just gets me.
DR. KELSO
Welcome to rounds, kids. Patient number
one...
J.D (V. 0.)
Bottom line, Elliot is the girl of my
dreams.
DR. KELSO
..the necrosis, and infected stool most
likely indicate what, Dr. Dorian?
ELLIOT
I don't know.(whispers)
Sir... J.D.
I have no idea.
DR. KELSO
Well, I'm very disappointed in you, son.
Dr. Reid, can you help him out? *
ELLIOT
I'd say it's superior mesenteric
insufficiency.
DR. KELSO
That's my girl. Patient number two...
J.D (V.0.)
The only way to bounce back is to stay
positive.
J.D.
Ms. Pratt,(cheery)I'm here to remove some of
that fluid from your belly, relieve a
little of that tightness.
MS. PRATT
Shut up and do it.
J.D.
Fantastic. 
Ma'am, I'm going to need you to roll over
for just a second.
TURK (0.S.)
Nice.
J.D.
You can roll back, ma'am. Now this'll
just take a second...
J.D (V.O.)
C'mon. Not in front of Turk. Just jam
the razor sharp needle into her gut.

J.D.
I think this needle is too big. I'm gonna
get a nurse.
TURK
Learn by doing, man. Learn by doing.

J.D (V.0.)
I hated him at that moment. For being
able to do that, for being happy...

TURK
Maybe it was too big a needle.
J.D.
You think? How do I seal this up?
TURK
You want my gum? -
MS. PRATT

What's going on down there?
TURK
This is totally normal, ma'am. Just have
to put some pressure on it.

J.D.
So, you going to move your stuff in
tonight?
TURK
That's why I came by. I just feel like
we've done that already, you know?
TURK
It might be
little... good for us to branch out a
What do you think?
J.D (V.0.)
Tell him you miss him. Tell him you need
him to look into your eyes and say that
everything's going to be fine just like
he did when
Tell him the cop pulled you over.
J.D.
Yeah, I feel the same way.
MR. BURSKI
I just have bad gas. What're you testing
me for?
J.D.
We need to know if your gas could be
harmful to others.
J.D.
Look, Mr. Burski, I heard a systolic murmur
in your heart, which is most likely
nothing, but if you don't let me check it
out I'm gonna worry about you all day.
MR. BURSKI
Seriously?
J.D.
Yeah, it would drive me crazy.
MR. BURSKI
Then I'll do it. For you.
So what's it like being a young hotshot
doctor?
J.D.
Did you ever go to see a movie that
everyone told you was great, then because
of all those expectations, you ended up
totally disappointed?
MR. BURSKI
Movies nowadays have too
many special effects. 
J.D.
Yeah, that was pretty much my point.
MR. BURSKI
Kid,you want to know my philosophy of life? 
It might help.
J.D.
Lay it on me, Mr. Burski.
MR. BURSKI
The hell with everything.
J.D.
I like that.
J.D (V.0.)
My first code. See, here's how it works.
Someone's heart fails , they beep in the first doctor
who has to run in and tell everyone in the room what to do, basically decide
the patient lives or dies...
What, am I crazy?
J.D.
You chicken.
ELLIOT
Me? Look at you.
J.D (V.O.)
Don't worry about the patient. Turk was
already there "learning by doing".
TODD
Fire up the juice, baby.
TURK
Clear.

J.D (V.O.)
Plus it turns out the guy was just slightly
anesthetized attached to a faulty monitor.

J.D.
I thought, I don't know, maybe we cared
about each other.
ELLIOT
Oh please, if you didn't want to sleep
with me you would've done the same thing.
J.D.
I didn't want to sleep with you.
ELLIOT
Uh-huh. And Turk's getting married?
J.D.
Yes, he is... eventually: I'll tell you
one thing. There's nothing in the world
that would make me sleep with you now.
ELLIOT
Do me right here.
J.D.
Okay.
ELLIOT
See?
J.D.
Damn.

DR. COX
Right. Hand me a trach kit, please?

ELLIOT
Great.
J.D.
Our date is totally canceled.J.D (V.O.)
I was sitting on the floor for two reasons.
One, I tried to lock Elliot in that supply
closet and she kicked me. Hard. And
two, the on-call room was locked.
J.D.
C'mon, I've got like ten minutes to sleep.

TURK
Tell me if I'm going too fast.
CARLA
Lose the clothes.

J.D (V.0.)
I heard that Turk was going to move in
with Todd. I'm surprised that high-fiving
freak isn't in there with him.
TODD
Look at you, T-man! You're on fire!
CARLA
Nice.
TURK
Your turn.
CARLA
Nah, I've gotta get back. But very nice.
TURK
I'm off Friday, you feel like making me
dinner?
CARLA
Que me estas Biciendo?
TURK
Or I could take you out. Your call.
CARLA
Date a surgeon? With the God complex and
the married-to-the-work?

Hey Bambi.
TURK
You coming in?
J.D.
Thought I might wait for you not be naked.

J.D.
You look adorable.
MR. BURSKI
Ah, the hell with everything.
J.D.
Hey, I got your test results. You're
gonna be fine. One more night and you're
out of here.

MR. BURSKI
Thank you. Thank you so much.
J.D.
No problem.
PATIENT (0.S.)
Nurse... Nursey... Cutie pie...
ELLIOT
I'm a doctor, okay. The white coat, the
stethoscope - a doctor, got it?
CARLA
Relax.
ELLIOT
I just hate it. I hate the "darlin's", I
hate the "sweethearts"...
CARLA
You don't need to tell me how hard it is
being a woman around here.
ELLIOT
Well, you're certainly furthering the
cause by wearing a thong to work and
hooking up in the on-call room.

ELLIOT (CONT'D)
Word gets around.
CARLA
You talk like that, do you even know my
name? I'm 34, I spend every second of my
life either here, or taking care of my
mom, so yeah, maybe I needed a little
closeness. I'm sure you never had a
quickie at the club, or snuck some skinny,
flat-butted, college boy up to your
sorority room, and judge me? And my
thong - I like to think it makes my ass
look good, and some days I need to feel
good about something around here, and you
judge me? Well, guess what. Word does
get around, Ms. "Out for herself", so you
can dump on everyone here if you want,
but you will not hurt me.
You will not hurt me...
J.D.
Look at you making new friends.

J.D,
I couldn't get any sleep 'cause Turk
practically had sex in the on-call room.
DR. COX
You are aware that I have no idea who
Turk is, but good for him. 'Cause Billy,
sex is life-affirming. Now, how bout you
give me a urine sample, captain.
BILLY
But I just did five minutes ago.
DR. COX
Tell you what. This time put the cup on
the ground and just go nuts.

J.D,
Seems like a good kid.
DR. COX
Yeah. Why are you here?
J.D (V.0.)
I'm worried about being on-call tonight.
DR. COX
You're worried about being on call tonight.
J.D.
No.
J.D (V.0.)
I don't think I can handle it.
DR. COX
You don't think you can handle it, do
you?
J.D (V.O.)
Stop doing that.
DR. COX
Look, worst case scenario, you kill someone
and it hangs over your head your whole
life, but that's absolute worst case.
Jeez, Newbie, just use the nurses for all
the stuff you're still too chicken to do,
which is, if I'm guessing, everything. And
there's a really tough admission--
J.D.
Call you?
DR. COX
God, no. I was going to say you can hide
in the closet again.

BILLY
That was mean.
DR. COX
Yeah, maybe... You forgive me, pal?
BILLY
I will if you talk about sex some more.
DR. COX
Boobies.
DR. KELSO
Hey champ. First night on call starts
soon, huh? Gosh, you must be excited.
J.D.
You betcha.
DR. KELSO
Oh, About Mrs. Pratt - I heard that you
want to put her on the hospital's
transplant list. Just thought I'd
recommend sticking with dialysis a while
longer. Maybe we'll get lucky.
J.D.
No problem.
DR. KELSO
Great. Have a ball, on-call. Little
poem for ya.
J.D.
I'll check on-you every ten minutes, okay,
Mrs. Marino?
NURSE ROBERTS *
I need you in Mr. Burski's room.
J.D.
Are you flirting with me?
NURSE ROBERTS *
He crashed while you were admitting in
the E.R. The attending thinks it was a
pulmonary embolism, no way anyone could've
it. Anyway, you have to pronounce
J.D.
But the tests said he was fine.

-NURSE ROBERTS
Could you just pronounce him so I can go
home?
J.D (V.0.)
I'll never forget that moment. The
moonlight on his face. The stillness.
The shame that all I could think about *
was how hard this was for me.
J.D.
Time of death 0200.
J.D (V.0.)
The hell with everything.
PIZZA GUY
What happened?
J.D.
You were delivering a pizza to the
emergency room, and apparently our sliding
glass door malfunctioned, and you just
ran right into the glass. You're going
to be fine, but you gave yourself a good
concussion, so you might have a little
short term memory loss, maybe some nausea.
PIZZA GUY
What happened?
J.D (V.0.)
Oh, make it stop.
TURK (0.S.)
Man, I lied before, I'm scared every
second.
Really?
TURK
Jeez, J.D., all the blood. Thank God for
the surgical mask, man, 'cause without it
everyone would know that I look like this
whole time.
J.D.
I think it's okay to be scared.
TURK
Yeah? I really need you to tell me stuff
like that once in a while...
J.D (V.0.)
He needs me?

TURK
Anyway, I just wanted to check on you.
J.D (V.0O.)
Just say it.
J.D.
You know the offer still stands if
want to you
move in with--
TURK
Already took the keys from your bag.

PIZZA GUY
What happened?
J.D.
I'll tell you later.
J.D (V.0.)
And like that, I got a second wind.

ELLIOT
Are you telling everyone that I screwed
you over at rounds?
J.D.
Not everyone. Only the people that work
here. Oh, and my parents.

DR. KELSO
Morning. How're you holding up?
J.D (V.0.)
Ahh, there he is. My safety net.
DR. KELSO
I saw that you're still pushing for putting
Mrs. Pratt on the transplant list. Bad
news though, sport, she doesn't have the
insurance to cover it--
J.D.
Yeah, but the lady's a second away from
total renal failure--
DR. KELSO
Uh-huh, Okay. Did you ask the Burski
family for permission to do an autopsy?
J.D.
They're still in there with him...
DR. KELSO
This is a teaching hospital, son. Gotta
ask.
J.D (V.O.)
Just tell him how you'll ask every time
from now on, but you can't face those
people again. He'll understand.
J.D,
Sir, do you think I could just skip this
one?
DR. KELSO
Sure, sport.
J.D (V.0.)
See? Every story needs a good guy.
DR. KELSO
In fact, why don't you just head home,
you look tired.
g.D.
I am pretty tired.
DR. KELSO
Mr. Dorian, do you not realize that you're
nothing but a couple of large pairs of
surgical scrubs to me? For God's sake,
the reason I carry this chart around is
so I can pretend to remember all your
damn names. Now, if the patient has
insurance, treat them, if not, show them
the door. And if someone dies, you get
the autopsy. You get it by rounds
tomorrow, or I'll be crossing your name
Off my chart, are we clear...? Answer
me.

J.D.
Crystal clear, sir.
DR. KELSO
Great, sport.

J.D (V.O.)
I don't get it. If he's a jerk, then
who's the good guy?
CARLA
Car accident, he was stable in the E.R.,
went into arrest about twenty seconds ago. 
DR. COX
We need to relieve the pressure in the
chest. J.D., do it.
J.D (V.O.)
Oh, God, no.
DR. COX
Look at me. You can do this.
J.D (V.O.)
And I believed him...
J.D.
tray.
J.D (V.O.)
Kinda.
Oh man, oh man, oh man--
J.D.
I can't pop it through the pleura.
DR. COX
Don't be gentle, c'mon now...

J.D.
Connect it, please Carla.
CARLA
Normal rhythm.
J.D.
No way.
DR. COX
See? Piece of cake.
Your patient.
J.D.
You don't have to go if you don't want
to...
DR. COX
Your patient, Doctor.
CARLA
Go ahead.
DR. COX
Billy, apparently your parents are upset
about some language they think you might
have picked up here.
BILLY
Boobies.
DR. COX
Let me scare some sense into him.
Let's hear it.
BILLY
Bagima.
DR. COX
Atta boy.
J.D (V.0.)
So I guess that's it for now. Thirty- one
hours, twelve minutes and I am--
ELLIOT
You finally off?
J.D.
Almost... I have one more really annoying
thing to do.
ELLIOT
If you're talking about getting the Burski
autopsy, I already called the family for
you and they said fine, and to thank you,
and I'm sorry... They didn't say that
last part, I did.
J.D (V.0.)
The worst part was knowing right then
that I could never forgive her.
ELLIOT
I'm really sorry.

J.D (V.O.)
I forgive her... You see, I can't survive
on my own.
JEFFERY
I'm a tool-I'm a tool.

J.D (V.0.)
Even now, when I finally get to go home
and go to sleep, in the back of my head,
I'll know the hospital's still here.
Wide awake. Waiting for me to come back
tomorrow so it can try to beat me.
CARLA
Bambi, get out while you still can.

But what the hell. The most important
thing is that I got through my
days without looking like a complete idiot.
ELLIOT
Get a gurney!
CARLA
Damn door...
JANITOR
If you ask me he had it coming.

J.D (V.0.)
I'm the man.
