MOM 1
I nursed Zach til he was 22 months...
LISA
Excuse me...
MOM 2
Weren't you worried about nipple
confusion?
LISA
Excuse me...
MOM 1
No. He went right from my breast toa
sippy cup.
LISA
That happened to me once. Can I get by?
MOM 2
What about silicone nipple shields?
MOM 1
If you had kids, you would not be
laughing!
LISA
Whoa, whoa. Excuse me. There's a line,
buddy.

GUY
There's two lines.
LISA
No, what? No. There's one line, we're in
it.
GUY
I don't think so.
LISA
You don't think so? You think there's
two lines and we all chose to be in this
one and you're the only genius who got in
the other line?
Do you believe this guy?
LISA (CONT'D)
What are you doing?! He screws you over
and now you're lining up behind him?
Lisa down.
LISA (CONT'D)
Will not one of you stand with me?!
GUY
Hey, shut up--
What kind do you want?
Shut up?!! Lisa is now at the front of her line, boiling
mad.
COUNTER GIRL
Can I help you?
LISA
Yeah, Teli take everything. I want every
bagel in this place.
I'm buying all the bagels.

ALL
What?! Come on, lady. Boo! Etc...
LISA
It's for the qood of everyone!

KENNETH
And this is the set of the "Friday Night
Bits with Jenna DeCarlo."
(points to standee)
It's a real funny ladies' comedy show for
ladies.
TOURIST
What time is it on?
KENNETH
Fridays at 10. But, seriously, sir, it's
just for ladies. Candy quiz! Can
anybody name other shows that only ladies
like?
TOURIST
Desperate Housewives?

KENNETH
Yes.
Kenneth throws the guy a piece of candy.
TOURIST 2
"Sex in The City?"
KENNETH
No.
I'm sorry, it's Sex and the City. I
cannot accept that.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Hey, everybody, here's someone you'd
never get to meet. This is the head-
writer of Friday Night Bits, Lisa Lemon.
LISA
Hi.
PETE
What's up? Have you looked at that
"Judgemental Baby" sketch? Cause it's
still seven minutes long.
LISA
Yikes, okay. Hey, you gotta tell that
NBC page to take it down a notch.
PETE
Who Kenneth?
LISA
He just embarrassed me in front of a
whole tour group.

PETE
talk to him.
What's this?
LISA
(smiles)
I was in the bagel store and this quy
comes in--
SARIE
Friday Night Bits. Okay, hold on, I'l
connect you.
She somehow looks sexy
Frank stare at her. Next call.transferring calls. Toofer and
SARIE (CONT'D)
Friday Night Bits. Our fax number?
LISA
And I was like, "Give me all the bagels,
dammit!"
PETE
Wow. That is the longest stroy I've ever
had to listen to to get a free bagel.

TOOFER
Chumley, you have got to talk to someone
upstairs about getting us a stock of
beverages.
LISA
Good morning.
TOOFER
I mean, surely our massive conglomerate
parent company could spring for a samovar
of coffee.
FRANK
Or, like, a big coffee dispenser.
TOOFER
That's what a samovar is.
FRANK
Sorry, I wasn't raised gay.
JOSH
Hey, who does this sound like?
"My fellow Americans, the situation in
Iraq grows more tense each day. The
insurgeons and evil-spreaders has left me
no choice but to ask for a do-over."
TOOFER
Martin Van Buren?
FRANK
Ron Jeremy?
JOSH
No, it was supposed to be your mom.
FRANK
No. My mom's voice is way lower.

TOOFER
Dude, can we at least send out for
coffee?
LISA
Yeah, but I'm not treating. I just spent
$600 on bagels. Wanna know why?
ALL
Nah... no thanks... etc.
LISA
Sarie, can we order some coffees?
SARIE
Yeah, I'll have a soy latte.
LISA
Sarie, soy latte. Josh?
JOSH
Large oreo brownie mochaccino, please.
With whipped cream.
LISA
Must be nice. Toofer?
TOOFER
Short non-fat Ethiopian Yergacheffe.
FRANK
That's what you are, isn't it?
TOOFER
And if they don't have that blend then,
please, just a steamed milk with a skoche
of Amarretto syrup.
LISA
You really are gross.
LISA (CONT'D)
Frank?
FRANK
A hamburger.
LISA
That's not...
FRANK
What? It's the same price.
LISA
Fine.
PETE
--and you probably don't need to
introduce the writers to the tour group.
KENNETH
I agree. I thought they would find it
interesting, but they really did not. So
I took them downstairs and showed them
Debra Norville's private toilet--
KENNETH
.-.to be used by no one but her.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Cops !
PETE
Yeah, it's been my experience, Kenneth,
that peaple do best with as little
information as possible.
If you pass a celebrity with the tour
group, just respect their privacy.
KENNETH
I don't know. Conan O'Brien gets real
mad if I don't make a big fuss over him.
PETE
Okay, well, feel it out. Make eye
contact with the person. Try to read
their facial expression. Do they want
the attention?
KENNETH
I promise I'll get it right, Mr.
Hornberger.
PETE
I'm sure you will.
KENNETH
I just love television so much.
PETE
We all do.
LISA
And I was, like, "Screw you! I'm buying
all the bagels!"
FRANK
That's great. You should make that into
a movie for the Lifetime Network.
TOOFER
"All the Bagels: The Lisa Lemon Story."
LISA
Starring Linda Hunt. Okay, where were
we?
FRANK
Bottom of 4. "Hey, kids, who wants a big
bowl of Flakey-o's?"
LISA
I don't like "Flakey-o's." What's a
better fake cereal name?
FRANK
Oat Bung?
TOOFER
Chocolate Log Jam.
LISA
Cornholes?
FRANK
Sugar Cornholes.
TOOFER
Frosted mini-guns.
LISA.
Meat Puffs?
TOOFER
Kashi Go Poo.
LISA
Pete. Fake cereal name.
PETE
Branfuckers.
LISA
We have a winner.
SARIE
Pete, they want you and Lisa on the 50th
floor.
PETE
Who, Gary?
TOOFER
Get him to pay for my Samovar.
LISA
I'll get it. I'll get it right now. I'm
still fired up from my bagel incident.

JOSH
(to Frank)
What bagel incident?
FRANK
If you ask her, I will stab you.
LISA
What do we want?
TOOFER
A coffee maker, coffee, and an array of
milks.
FRANK
Three cases of name-brand soda a day.
SARIE
Cable tv.
TOOFER
A snack basket.
yy JOSH
LISA
Josh, bend it, don't break it.
LISA
Gary will give us all this, right?
PETE
Of course he will. He's the nicest man
in the world. Remember when he found
that baby bird in the park?

GARY LUDERMAN
Hey, fella. Hey, fella.
I'm gonna name him Fella.
LISA
(sings)
Gary Luderman is the nicest man in the
wooorld!
They turn the corner into...
LISA
Where's Gary?
JACK
Gary's dead. I'm Jack Donaghy. New VP
of development for
NBC/GE/Universal/Vivendi/ Kmart
PETE
We own Kmart now?
JACK
No, we don't. So why are you dressed
like we do?
SARIE
Friday Night Bits.
This is Sarie.
(exasperated)
Mommy, why are you calling me?
JOSH
Are you guys just staring at the new
receptionist or are you actually trying
to levitate her with your minds?
IOOFER
Shhh, I have to hear this.
SARIE
Of course I showed up for work. You
don't have to, like, check on me all the
time.
I (quietly)
took the helicopter.
FRANK
Her parents are some rich famous big
shots and they got her this job because
they want her to learn the value of work.
JOSH
Who are her parents?
FRANK
She won't say.
TOOFER
She says it would affect the way we treat
her.
JOSH
No, I would still try to make out with
her.

FRANK
She doesn't do it for me. My perfect
woman is a standard size 12, still in her
waitress uniform, with her kid asleep in
the next room,
KENNETH
Rockefeller Center was built in the
1930's by--anyone?
TOURIST
The Rockefellers?
KENNETH
Correct. Studio 8E was constructed in
1951 for a show called "The Vicks Vap-o-
Rub Fun Hour." In the 1970's it was used
for a talk show by a gentleman named Phil
Donahoo. And now it's home to the Jenna
DeCarlo--
TOURIST 6
Hey, that's Jenna DeCarlo!
OTHERS
Ooh, Jenna DeCarlo! Jenna! Etc.

JENNA
Hi, let me explain that I'm really hung
over right now and that's why I look like
this. But I'm not normally hung over on
a Wednesday. I tried a new tapas
restaurant in my neighborhood last night
and the waiter recognized me so he kept
giving me free mojitos-- which doesn't
happen all the time, I'm not like, some
gross famous person-- but he kept
bringing them and I don't usually drink
hard liquor cause I'm really small and I
can get drunk so easily--
I mean, I don't get drunk frequently.
JENNA (CONT'D)
I'm just saying that if I look a little
green there are extenuating
circumstances.

KENNETH
How about that? Jenna DeCarlo, every--
JENNA
But I don't want people to think I'm not
friendly. I'm just nauseous and I have
stomach issues--
JENNA (CONT'D)
Okay.
JENNA (CONT'D)
Forget I said "stomach issues." Okay.
Bye.

PETE
I'm surprised you're renovating. This is
such a nice office.
JACK
It's a great office. But sometimes you
have to change things that are perfectly
good just to make them your own.
JACK (CONT'D)
call her back. Is she at the White
House number?
JACK (CONT'D)
Tell them I need a 4 a.m. tee time.
JACK (CONT'D)
About five inches, but it's thick.
JACK (CONT'D)
Are you familiar with the award-winning
GE Tri-vection oven?
LISA
I don't cook very much,
JACK
Sure. I got you. New York third wave
feminist. College-educated. Single and
pretending to be happy about it. Over-
scheduled, under-sexed. You buy any
magazine that says "healthy body image"
on the cover, but your kitchen's got
nothing but Snackwells and expired
yogurts. You reject traditional female
roles, but every two years you take up
knitting for a week.
PETE
That's dead on.
LISA
Are you gonna guess my weight now?
JACK
You don't want me to do that.
PETE
That knitting thing is just uncanny. How
do you do that?
JACK
Market research, my friend. Years and
years of market research... that lead to
my greatest triumph, the Tri-vection
oven.
PETE
My wife wants one of those.
JACK
Yes, but I'il need my kevlar vest.
The Trivection oven cooks perfect food
five times faster than a conventional
even, because it uses three kinds of
heat: thermal technology, for consistent
temperature; GE Precise Airâ„¢ convection
technology, for optimal air circulation;
and microwave technology, for
unbelievable speed. With three kinds of
heat, you can cook a turkey in 22
minutes.
PETE
Wow. That's impressive.
JACK
The people upstairs agree. That's why
they promoted me. That's why I'm here to
re-tool your show.
LISA
Re-tool what now?
JACK
I'm the new Vice President of East Coast
Television and Microwave Oven
Programming.
LISA
That sounds like you program microwave
ovens.
JACK
See, I told you that was imprecise. Make
it "Vice President of East Coast
Television Programming and Microwave Oven-
LISA
Czar?
JACK
I like you. You have the boldness of a
much younger woman.
PETE
You know, Jack, Lisa and I have worked
together on a bunch of shows over the
last ten years, and I know Gary was very
pleased--
JACK
Pete, I've seen the show. The littie
gal's good.
LISA
Jenna.
JACK
And the skits are decent, but you're
missing that third kind of heat.
LISA
There's the kind of heat that rises from
dog poop. Maybe we could use that.
JACK
Think about Lawrence Jordan.
PETE
The black guy?
JACK
The black movie star. I flew with him
recently on a private jet to the Super
Bowl, and he was very entertaining.
LISA
Isn't he, um... crazy?
JACK
Lawrence has had his problems in the last
few years.
LAWRENCE
I am a jedi! I ama jedi!
JACK
But it's important to remember that he
was never charged with any crime. It's
not illegal to fall asleep on your
neighbor's roof.
PETE
Nor should it be.
JACK
Lawrence Jordan is the "third heat."
PETE
So would he join the cast...?
s
JACK
Join the cast, permanent guest host-- I'm
going to meet with him this afternoon and
see what he thinks--
JACK (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
LISA
Sometimes when I have these stress
dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I
come out of it.
LISA (CONT'D)
"This is not a dream."
JACK
Jonathan, take Pete and help him pick out
a Trivection oven for his wife. 
PETE
(pleased)
Hey.
LISA
Wait.
LISA (CONT'D)
We also want a coffee machine, a snack
basket --
JACK
Done. Jonathan?
JACK (CONT'D)
Lisa, I've heard a lot of good things
about you,
LISA
Well, a lot of that stuff I don't do
anymore.
JACK
I just want you to know that your job is
secure. You're gonna be essential to
transforming the show.
LISA
No, no, no, Jack. Jenna is my friend and
we like our show the way it is. It may
not get the highest ratings, but we have
our own little following, and I'm not
going to let you come in here and turn it
into some kind of--
JACK
Hit?
LISA
Just let me talk to her before you make
any concrete--
LISA (CONT'D)
Mother-effer-!
JOSH
Yes, I have an appointment with Louise.
JENNA
Glouise isn't here. I'm Bevergly.
JENNA (CONT'D)
And I'll be your substitute hair
styglist!

IOOFER
We should do one where "Bevergly" is a
"grape" counselor.
JOSH
Just tell me who your parents are.
SARIE
No. You couldn't handle it.
JOSH
Okay, I'm gonna try to guess who they are
from looking at your face.
JOSH (CONT'D)
Blond hair, little nose, kind of
Swedish... Your mom is... Cheryl Tiegs
and your dad is...
Stephen Hawking.
Sarie punches him in the arm.
JOSH (CONT'D)
What? Cause you're smart!
PETE
...and Jenna DeCarlo was very upset.
KENNETH
I tried to read her face, but it's so
rubbery!

PETE
How bout this? As a rule, if you see a
celebrity when you're with the tour
group, do not bother them.
KENNETH
Is that a quideline, or a rule? Cause I
respond well to structure.
PETE
Let's say it's a rule.
LISA
Hey.
JENNA
Hey. What happened to your head?
LISA
The sky is falling. Do you have a
minute?
JENNA
No. I have a costume fitting for the
"Judgemental Baby" sketch.
LISA
Ahh. I'11 find you after.
JENNA
You seem upset.
LISA
You seem upset.
JENNA
I'm hung over.
LISA
Remember, like, five years ago when you
were still waitressing and I was temping
at that law firm and we used to do improv
shows for free at night?
JENNA
Yeah.
LISA
Did we hate it?
JENNA
Yeah. We hated it a lot.
LISA
That's what I thought.
TOOFER
Well done, m' lady!
FRANK
How'd you get everything so fast?
LISA
What can I say? I'm a hardass.
PETE
Well, my condolences. Please let me know
where we can send flowers. Okay.
PETE (CONT'D)
Ugh, poor Gary.
LISA
How did he die?
PETE
Killed by a deer.
LISA
What?

PETE
He used to feed the deer every morning at
his house upstate. And then he got an
injunction from the township saying he
had to stop. So he did. Two days later,
he goes out to get his paper, and the
deer go mad.
LISA
They just went mad?
PETE
He stopped feeding them and they turned
on him.
LISA
What are we gonna do? We quit, right?
Do we quit?
PETE
Not me. My twins need braces.
f
LISA
The older twins or the identicals?
PETE
All four. They've got mouths like
piranhas.
He hands her a picture from his desk.
LISA
Ew. They do.
PETE
But sometimes with a thing like this, if
you wait it out, it goes away on its own.
LISA
No, you gotta get the braces.
PETE
Jack Donaghy, I'm talking about. So he
meets with crazy Lawrence Jordan today.
Jordan'11 ask for too much money or he'll
show up wearing a child's swimsuit and a
shower cap and Donaghy will change his
mind. Nobody needs to know this ever
came up.
Josh enters.
JOSH
Oh, hey, awesome. Just the people I was
looking for. I'm working on this bit
about celebrities doing commercials, like-
(imitates Christopher Walken perfectly)
"This is Christopher Walken for Tropicana
orange juice. Try the juice. It's
very... tangy" Or, um--
"Yo, this is Lawrence Jordan, star of
'Black Cop/White. Cop' and when I want a
good night's sleep, I sleep on my
neighbor's roof. But now that I'm making
a comeback, I sleep at the Best Western.
Best Western. It's like sleeping on Ted
Danson's roof. Holla!"
LISA
Okay, I don't know what you've heard, but
Lawrence Jordan is not joining the cast.
He is not taking over for Jenna. We are
not turning into The Lawrence Jordan
Show.
JOSH
What?
LISA
Nothing.
PETE
Nicely handled.
KENNETH
Yes, Katie Couric is real tiny in person.

KENNETH (CONT 'D)
'But her boobs are a lot bigger than you
would think.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Now, if y'all look over here, you'll see
a water fountain!
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Does anyone have any questions about it?
Lawrence gives his posse a look like, "What the heli?
Why isn't this guy acknowledging me?"
LAWRENCE
Yes, I have a question.
How do you feel, NBC Tour? Cause you
look like a portay!
KENNETH
Lawrence Jordan, everybody.
LAWRENCE
You're beautiful, little Mama. You're
doing God's work.
Don't I know you from the insurance
meeting? We've got to sign those papers,
Reginald.


LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
Listen. I know being your age is hard.
But don't you "put on the trench coat."
You hear me? You have a problem, you
call me. Don't put on that trench coat.
LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
Live. Life. Love. Laugh!
JOSH
Does Jenna know?
LISA
I gotta tell her before she hears it
somewhere else.
JOSH
She's been around the block. She can
handle bad news.
LISA
Yeah...
Off Lisa's look...
JENNA
(dejected)
I said wheat toast.
She bursts into tears.

LISA
She's gonna freak out.
TOOFER
I will not work with Lawrence Jordan.
PETE
It's just a rumor.
TOOFER
I worked with him at the MTV awards two
years ago, where he found it endlessly
amusing to show me his johnson.
PETE
How was it?
TOOFER
Considerable. On one cccasion, he had
placed it in a foot-long hot dog bun and
put mustard on it. I loathe him.
SARIE
He's not that bad. He rents near us in
East Hampton. I saw him once at a charity
polo match.
PETE
Did he seem crazy?
SARIE
No. Well... he was making out with
Martha Stewart...but we've all done that.
Joking.
TOOFER
Have you seen any of his movies? The
guy's sensibility is just cretinous.
LISA
I saw the one where he plays, like, five
different characters.

TOOFER
"Black Cop/White Cop"
LISA
No.
JOSH
"Who Dat Ninja?"
LISA
No, he was... god, they all blend
together, don't they? He had to pretend
to be an old lady--
TOOFER
Yes, yes. He actually says the title at
one point...
Off their thinking...
LAWRENCE
Oh, gracious goodness! You hooligans
better watch out!

LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
Cause this honky arandma be trippin!
LISA/TOOFER
"Honky Grandma Be Trippin'."
JOSH
Oh, yeah. That movie was hilarious.

FRANK
Is what I heard true?!
PETE
No!
FRANK
Gary Luderman got killed by a deer?!
PETE
Oh yeah, by the way, everybody. Gary
Luderman got killed by a deer.
JENNA
You guys, you have to come see this! You
know that crazy actor guy from "Who Dat
Ninja?" He's in our studio! It's
hilarious! You have to see it.
LAWRENCE
I'm back, America! I'm coming into your
house.
LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
I'm coming into your house, America!
JACK
We love you, Lawrence! Come into our
homes?

LAWRENCE
I'm the third heat! I'm the third heat!
JACK
You're the third heat, baby!
JENNA
This guy's full-tilt nuts. Am I right?
KENNETH
Here we see the set for "Friday Night
Bits."
JENNA
What did he say?
LISA
Jenna, I have some news. Don't freak
out.
JENNA
I am a jedi! I am a jedi!


LAWRENCE JORDAN
Now at the time, me and Eddie were both
talking to the same girl, 'cept I didn't
know she was a transexual...
Everyone laughs.
LISA
Will not one of you stand with me?
LISA (CONT'D)
Would you like me to review for you
everything you've done wrong so far?
You've hired a guy so crazy that nobody
else in the world will work with him
right now. You brought him in here
without even talking to Jenna first,
which will send her into a two-year
spiral. You're putting him in my hands,
knowing I don't want him here. You gave
my greedy, insatiable writing staff every
toy they asked for, which only means they
will have a longer list of things they
want tomorrow. Don't stop feeding those
deer, Mr. Donaghy, or they will turn on
you.
JACK
You'll make it work.
LISA
What makes you think that?
JACK
Cause your friend Jenna's got nowhere
else to go. You'll be nice to Lawrence,
cause it's not his fault. And you'll
focus all your rage and hatred on me.
LISA
Ugh, you know what? You don't know
everything about me.
JACK
About 127 pounds.
LISA
Hi, I'm Lisa. I'm--
LAWRENCE
Yes, yes. Lisa Lemon! I know who you
are.
LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
The very talented. Very talented.
LISA
Oh, well. Let's not.
LAWRENCE
You're gonna be my Phil Spector, right?
LISA
How's that?
LAWRENCE
You're gonna take my raw black sound and
make it nice for white people's ears.
LISA
Yes. And then I'm gonna kill somebody.
Lawrence thinks this is hilarious.
LISA
Hi, I'm here to pick up my baby.
JENNA
Tadeo, another mojito!
LISA
No, no. Come on, friend.
Can I borrow this for five minutes?
JENNA
I have so much rage.
LISA
It could be worse. You could have nipple
confusion.
