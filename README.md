# nlp-workplace-comedies

<This read.me is still a work in progress.
 In the meantime, please feel free to check out the individual notebooks; I've explained and analzed what I've done in those!>

The work in this project was inspired by (and borrowed considerably from) Alice Zhao's session at the PyOhio Conference in 2018. The code for the project she explains in detail is available at https://github.com/adashofdata/nlp-in-python-tutorial, and the recording of her session is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvqsFTUsOmc.
## What I did differently
1. The original project dealt with scripts of stand up comedy monologues by multiple comedians. Whereas, I used scripts of major US TV shows of the workplace comedy genre within the last two decades. Thus, the source data differs considerably from the that used in Alice Zhao's work.
 The shows I selected were: 
 <br>
 1. 30 Rock 
 2. Brooklyn Nine-Nine
 3. Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia
 4. The Mindy Project 
 5. Parks and Recreation 
 6. Scrubs
 7. Silicon Valley
 8. Superstore
 9. The Office
 10. Veep.
 <br>
2. I coded new additional modules on named entity recognition and document similarity,  as well as modified the EDA to suit the base corpus of TV scripts.
