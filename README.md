# nlp-workplace-comedies

The work in this project was inspired by (and borrowed considerably from) Alice Zhao's session at the PyOhio Conference in 2018. The code for the project she explains in detail is available at https://github.com/adashofdata/nlp-in-python-tutorial, and the recording of her session is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvqsFTUsOmc.
## Noteworthy differences between above project and mine:
1. The original project dealt with scripts of stand up comedy monologues by multiple comedians. Whereas, I located and selected scripts for the major workplace comedies within the last two decades. Thus, the source data shows considerable differences:
<br>
  (a) 1 person speaks in a stand-up monologue but multiple characters are involved in a TV show.<br>
  (b) The work of a comedian is largely independent, whereas a lot of elements (and teams) come together to conceptualize, write, and produce a TV show.<br>
  (c) Instead of one person who speaks with a consisent style, a workplace comedy involves multiple scenarios and a variety of characters woven together in a story.<br>
  (d) Stand-up comedy monologues last about 1 hour, whereas none of these comedies exceed a 30 min duration. This means more content packed in a shorter interval.<br>
  (e) Stand-up omedy is not everyone's cup of tea, but I'm yet to find someone who hasn't turned on the TV to watch a funny show with their favourite characters :)<br>
