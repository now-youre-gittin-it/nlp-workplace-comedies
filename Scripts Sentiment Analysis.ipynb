    "# Transcript Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts consist of two components- \n",
    "#### action \n",
    "and\n",
    "#### dialogue\n",
    "Analyzing just the transcript rather than the whole script allows us to focus on the sentiment of dialogues (and therefore, the characters) rather than relying on cues provided by action (i.e., screen direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the transcripts of the pilot (i.e., first) episodes of 10 English TV shows of the 'workplace comedy' genre are analyzed to observe the styles across shows and identify considerably similar/different shows. Some of the top shows in this genre that were released between 2001 and 2016 were included in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1: Although web scraping to obtain these scripts was attempted initially, the non-uniformity across scripts and lack of availability from a single source prevented a streamlined implementation.\n",
    "The transcripts were obtained as scripts from various sources and the \"action\" components were manually omitted to ensure \"dialogue\" presence alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 2: Initial sentiment analysis was performed on the scripts rather than transcripts. However, the presence of several \"action\" statements that conveyed both emotion and information considerably affected the results. The script and transcript of the same show could exhibit greatly varying subjectivity and polarity. Hence, it seemed more advisable to stick to transcripts instead."

       "'Narrator: The American superstore. One-stop shopping for everything you could ever want or need. Do you want to be thinner? Fatter? Happier? Sadder? Are you looking for friendship? Or solitude? Or even love?  Amy: That\\'s actually a cubic zirconia knockoff. It\\'s called PlastiClear. Bo: What happened to the $8 ones? Amy: We\\'re all sold out of those, sorry. But this one\\'s only $2 more. Bo: I get it. You advertise the cheap jewelry to get the suckers in the door, then you push the expensive stuff. Amy: Well, I wouldn\\'t use the word \"suckers\" or \"expensive\" or \"jewelry\". Bo: Fine. I got to stand in line for cigarettes anyhow. Amy: Great. I hope you and your fiance are very happy together. And that you don\\'t procreate. Glenn? Glenn: Huh? Amy: I\\'m taking a mental-health break.  Glenn: Okay. Have fun now. Reflect.  Dina: Just checking over your new hire forms. American citizen. Nice. No dependents. Me neither, unless you count my birds. It just doesn\\'t say anywhere on here if you\\'ve got a girlfriend. Jonah: I didn\\'t, is there a space for that? Dina: There\\'s this section here, \"Is there anything else we should know?\" Some people like to volunteer it. Jonah: Oh. Umm, then also no. Dina: No. Jonah: No. Dina: Okay, well, I will just jot that down, then. But you are heterosexual, right? Jonah: Are you allowed to ask that? Dina: No. Amy: Smart. We always keep the best rolls right in the middle. Oh, wait. Jonah: No, no, no. Let me help you with that. Amy: Oh, no, no, no. I\\'m fine. Jonah: It\\'s fine, I work here. It\\'s, like, my it\\'s my job to help customers, so. Amy: You work here? Since when? Jonah: Since right now. I\\'m, it\\'s actually my first day. Amy: Oh. Jonah: I know. I don\\'t seem like the kind of person who would work in a place like this. Amy: Yeah, that\\'s why I was so surprised. I was like, \"What?\" \"What?\" \"Him?\" \"What\\'s he doing cleaning up toilet paper?\" I think it\\'s because you just you have this very intelligent, educated, more cultured quality, I mean, compared to yeah. Jonah: Oh, hey. Look, I get that you\\'re complimenting me, but it might sound a little condescending, so, you know. Amy: Oh, yeah, thanks. No, I wouldn\\'t want to sound condescending in front of somebody who works here. Jonah: Right. Cheyenne: Hey, can I run out for two minutes? This thing is kicking my bladder like it owes him money. Jonah: Oh, you know what, I\\'m actually not in charge. Amy: Yes, of course. I\\'ll take Carly off express. And Vivian can bag, so take as long as you need. Cheyenne: Ah, thanks. Amy: Little tip. Don\\'t let the other workers here know how much better than them you are. They hate that. I don\\'t know why, maybe because it sounds condescending. Welcome.  Dina: All right, campers, listen up. I\\'ve got an important announcement. This is your garden variety generic decongestant. And this is crystal meth, okay? The tweakers use this to make this. So stop selling them this, so they can\\'t make this. Cheyenne: That guy told me he had a really bad cold. Dina: He was buying 35 boxes, Cheyenne. That should have been a red flag, okay? Use your noggin. Glenn: Let\\'s thank Dina for that helpful tip of the day. Thank you, Dina. Garrett: Am I the only one that thinks it\\'s weird that she walking around with a bag of crystal meth? Jonah: Hey, listen. I think there might have been a misunderstanding. I\\'m not an elitist, so... Amy: Oh, elitist? What is that? Jonah: Like, a person who thinks they\\'re better than ... you know what elitist means. Amy: Oh, yeah. They learnt that to us in public school. Glenn: Anyway, I am so proud to welcome two new angels to our Cloud 9 family. Why don\\'t you introduce yourselves? Okay. Jonah: Hello, everyone. I am Jonah. And I am I am excited to be here. This is gonna be fun, so. Mateo: My name is Mateo Fernando Aquino Liwanag, and I\\'m here to make something of myself. Spread my wings Whoo! See how far I can fly. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Jonah: Yeah, I, too, would like to see how far I can fly. So. Garrett: Saved it. Jonah: Thank you. Glenn: Now, I used to end these meetings with some wisdom from the Good Book. But then someone reported me to corporate. Dina: Heck yeah, I did. Look, I\\'m a Christian too, but in these four walls, my bible is the employee code of conduct. Glenn: We all thank you for it. Dina: Yeah, you\\'re welcome. Glenn: I pray for you, Dina. Dina: I pray for you, too, Glenn. Glenn: No, I\\'m praying right now. Amy: I\\'m praying so hard. Glenn: I\\'m praying harder than you. I know how. So to welcome our new employees. Welcome. Welcome to Cloud 9. Garrett: This is my jam.  Jonah: Hey, do we have any kind of training? I\\'ve just been wandering from one department to another, trying to look like I have purpose. Garrett: It works better if you carry a box. There you go. See? You\\'ll learn as you go. Look, man, only a couple things to remember: always show up on time, don\\'t steal, and stay on the floor supervisor\\'s good side. Jonah: The floor, who\\'s the floor supervisor? Garrett: I got to go get another box. Jonah: Hey, can we can we start over? I\\'m Jonah, as you know. And you\\'re Ramona. Amy: Nope, that is not my name. I just don\\'t like random strangers using my name like we\\'re buddies. Jonah: Right, like how hookers don\\'t like to be kissed on the lips. Amy: Did you just compare me to a hooker? Jonah: No. Amy: You look bored. Let me help you with that. All electronics are supposed to be 25% off, but our POS system is down. So you scan, hit \"reassign,\" \"enter,\" \"override, yes,\" \"reduce 0.25,\" \"enter, yes, yes.\" You are not paying attention. Jonah: I\\'m sorry. Go ahead. Amy: \"Confirm,\" \"enter, yes.\" Got it? Jonah: If I guessed your name, would you tell me if I was right? Amy: Take this. Cheyenne: Oh, it\\'s so pretty! Jonah: I\\'ll make a list. Uptight Lady: Oh, excuse me, miss. Do you know the difference between a stool softener and a laxative? Amy: I\\'ll be right with you, ma\\'am. Cheyenne, what\\'s going on? Cheyenne: My boyfriend just asked me to marry him. UptightLady: I don\\'t want it soft. I want it out of me. Amy: You know, I hadn\\'t realized earlier that Cheyenne was the lucky girl you\\'d be proposing to. Bo: Yeah, well, I knocked her up, so my dad says I have to. Cheyenne: So romantic. Bo: That\\'s how I do it, yo. 100% love. UptightLady: Bulking agent? Why would I want more bulk? Ugh. Amy: Chey, you didn\\'t say yes, did you? Cheyenne: Why wouldn\\'t I say yes? Amy: Um Cheyenne, look at me. I know how easy it is to get swept up in the romance of all of this. But think it through, okay? Don\\'t do something you\\'re gonna regret for the rest of your life. UptightLady: Yeah, okay. I\\'m gonna go sleep on it.  Jonah: Hey. I think I got it down. Mateo: No offense, but you\\'re my competition, so I\\'m kind of actually rooting for you to fail. Okay, thanks. Bye. Jonah: Hey! I figured it out. Amy: We need new shelf flags for the end caps, but we should check the DCPs first, because last time. What is happening? Glenn: Could it be a race riot? It\\'s so hard to tell in the early stages. Could be the rapture, but then why am I still here? Jonah: Hey. I am killing it over here. Amy: You\\'re only discounting everything 25%, right? Jonah: Yeah, \"scan, \"reassign,\" \"yes,\" \"override,\" \"yes,\" \"reprice\". Amy: Reduce. Jonah: Huh? Amy: Reduce 0.25. Reprice 0.25? That would change everything to 25¢. Shut it down! Shut it all down! Cheyenne: If you sign up for our Heavenly Shoppers program today, you\\'ll save 15% off your purchase, which would drop your price to 22¢. Amy: Stop selling everything! Shut it down! Shut it all down! Sir, you need to stay right there. Frank, nobody leaves! Ma\\'am! Ma\\'am, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m gonna need to recheck some of these items. SoccerMom: No thank you, buh-bye. Amy: I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t just let you leave with a whole basket full of 25¢ tech, oww! SoccerMom: I have more where that came from, lady! Amy: Oh, I don\\'t think so! Garrett: Attention, shoppers. Due to an employee error, very expensive electronics are pricing out at 25¢. This mistake is being corrected, so stock up quick! Go, go, go, go! Jonah: What I\\'m trying to say is, this is not 25¢. Sir, no. No two-five, no. SoccerMom: It touched my car; it\\'s mine! Amy: That\\'s not a thing. SoccerMom: It is a thing. Mateo: I don\\'t want to be \"that guy,\" but if you had to compare my performance versus Jonah, uhh, okay. Garrett: Yeah, you better hurry up, girl. You better get that TV. Frank (Security Guard): Stop, stop! Please, I\\'m begging you! Jonah: She\\'s very, she\\'s, they\\'re very pretty, yep. Amy: Ow! Frank! Frank: Y\\'all don\\'t want to do this. Please! Dina: Sale\\'s over!  Glenn: There\\'s no need to identify whoever it is whose fault this was. We can all learn a lesson here. Mateo: Would that lesson be not letting Jonah reprice inventory in the future? Glenn: It might be, yes. All right. Punctuality. I do not tolerate it, because I do not tolerate it in myself. I am an angry man, so I get places early... Jonah: Hey do they allow employees to date supervisors? Garrett: I don\\'t know. Why? Jonah: Just curious. Glenn: Let\\'s always remember, the customer is always right.  Jonah: Hey, what\\'s-your-name, check it out. Amy: Ah. I was wondering what was taking so long to stack a few cans. Jonah: I just I wanted to reiterate how sorry I am about before. Amy: And when a customer wants a can of ginger root beer and the whole thing collapses on top of them, how are you gonna feel then? Jonah: I was just trying to have some fun. Amy: This might be a cultural thing, but around here, the less screwing everything up you do, the better. Jonah: You talking about the cans or the pricing thing? Amy: You see, the fact that it\\'s your first day and there\\'s already more than one option of things you screwed up is not a good thing. Jonah: Okay, I\\'ve made some mistakes. I can admit that, but that doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t have a little fun at work, does it? Or try and find some moments of beauty in the everyday? Amy: Wait, I\\'m sorry. Did you really just use the phrase \"moments of beauty,\" like, conversationally? Jonah: Okay, yes, that\\'s cheesy, but do you remember \"American Beauty\"? Even a plastic bag can be breathtaking. Amy: Wow. That really blew my mind. Like, boom, I have goose bumps. Jonah: I felt something. I\\'m Jonah. It\\'s my first day.  Cheyenne: Okay. Stay still. Dina: I don\\'t usually wear eyeliner. Sharpie occasionally, but... Cheyenne: So tell me about this special guy. Dina: Okay. Male, Caucasian, no discernible scars or tattoos. Cheyenne: Sounds dreamy. Dina: Yeah. Cheyenne: You know, speaking of boys, I\\'ve got a pretty big decision to make. My boyfriend, he... Dina: I\\'m glad we could bond like this. Thank you. Mateo: Excuse me, excuse me! Hi! I hung up everything that was in the dressing rooms, and I organized it by style, color, size, and relevance of designer. Amy: Wow. Good job. Mateo: I enjoy hard work. It\\'s just like my mom always said: \"If you don\\'t work hard, Baby Jesus will cry.\" Amy: Okay. Mateo: I don\\'t think I could be happy fooling around in the parking lot like the other new guy.  Jonah: Slow down! This is not fair! You have more experience on wheels than I do! Garrett: Your disability is not my concern! Amy: Seriously? The only thing I asked you to do was put the carts away. Jonah: That\\'s what I\\'m doing, just somewhat circuitously. Garrett: See you later, sucka! Amy: Are you trying to get fired? What if Glenn sees this? Glenn: Coming through! Move! Jonah: That doesn\\'t count. Glenn: Go, Glenn! Yeah! Yeah! Yes! In your faces! Your faces! Ha-ha! Amy: Okay. I get it. You\\'re the fun guy. I\\'m the stick in the mud. Well, I could be fun. I could have fun. Let\\'s have fun. Jonah: Of course you can have fun. Amy: Whoo! We\\'re playing at work. Jonah: No brakes! I have no brakes! No ooh!  Amy: Peace offering. Jonah: Are those the flowers that I picked up off the floor of the garden center? Amy: Yes. Jonah: They\\'re beautiful trash flowers. Amy: Look, I\\'m sorry, okay? I have been having a long day. Ten years of long days, actually. You know, I stock these glow stars every single year for the back-to-school sale. And then I take them down, and I put up the Halloween inventory, and then Thanksgiving and Christmas and Valentine\\'s Day and Easter and Fourth of July, and then back-to-school again. Jonah: Hmm. That sounds incredibly not fun. I see why you love it here. Amy: It\\'s a good job. But tomorrow is gonna be just like today, and I know that because today is just like yesterday. So sometimes it\\'s just kind of hard to find those moments of beauty.  Garrett: Attention, shoppers. Even a big box store has to close, and it\\'s about that time. You know, when Pandora closed her famous box, there was only one thing left inside - hope. I wonder what will be left inside of this box. Could it be Grace? I hope not. If you\\'re Grace\\'s parents, please pick her up at customer service.  Mateo: I took the initiative upon myself to reorganize the toy section for the convenience of adult shoppers. It was just feeling overly whimsical. Jonah: I want to show you something I\\'ve been working on. Mateo: Oh. You were working. Where? Because I\\'ve been in every single department, and I haven\\'t seen you in a couple hours, unless you were in, like, the break room maybe. Bo: Everybody get down on the ground, now! Get down, get down, get down! Touch the ground! Or get out! All right, calm down. Do what I say, and nobody gets hurt. Dina: This is what I trained for. Bo: Now, I\\'m gonna start killing somebody every minute, unless unless you agree to marry me, Cheyenne. Hit it! Garrett: Hey, what the... Bo: I\\'ll say, \"Will you marry me?\" Jonah: I had nothing to do with this. Amy: Yeah, I know. This is the fault of YouTube. Bo: Heard you want to walk down the aisle. Your baby needs a daddy, we\\'ve been bangin\\' for a while. All right, I pay the consequences of my actions. Don\\'t try to change me \\'cause I\\'m a man of action. Glenn: Yo! What a show. Dina: I\\'m calling to report a code green in progress. I repeat, code green. Operator: What\\'s a code green? Dina: I faxed you a list of codes last month! Hostage situation! You need to get SWAT down here right now! Bo: When all these people gonna learn? We\\'re gonna get burned, just waiting for our turn. Yo, #BlackLivesMatter, y\\'all. Okay, if you like what you heard and saw, I\\'m currently seeking representation in all areas. Also, I do modeling, so I\\'m just throwing that out there. All right, peace out, St. Louis. Cheyenne: Bo! Bo: What? Oh, my bad, yo. Cheyenne Tyler Lee, will you marry me? Or are you gonna be, like, a dick about it? Dina: Oh, I think he\\'s about to shoot a hostage. I\\'ll do what I can. Operator: Don\\'t do anything. Amy: What is this? Jonah: Moment of beauty?  Garrett: To Cheyenne. All: Cheers! Garrett: May your marriage be as sweet and colorful as this Cloud 9 brand caffeinated malt beverage, without the recall for killing college students. Cheyenne: Thank you, on behalf of myself and Bo. Amy: Well, he did make it memorable. I\\'ll give him that. Jonah: I mean, most guys don\\'t even bother threatening to kill you when they propose. Dina: You were never in any real danger. You know that, right? Jonah: Yeah, I know. It was a fake robbery. Dina: This is a high-velocity 440-grain lead flat-nose projectile with gas checks and a boxer-primed brass jacket. If he\\'d come within 10 feet of you, you would have seen his head explode like a watermelon. Cleanup on aisle I don\\'t even know what aisle it is, \\'cause his brains would be splattered all over the sign. Oh, shoot. Cheyenne: You know, I wish that we could wear jewelry at work. Amy: Oh, it\\'s so sparkly. Cheyenne: You know, I thought about what you said about not doing something that I might regret, but then, in the moment, you know, under the stars, it just felt right. Without you, I would have never said yes, so thank you. Jonah: Oh. Cheyenne: Well, I should go bail out my boyfriend now. Or I mean bail out my fiancé! Glenn: Aw. Amy: All right. I got to get going. Good night, everyone. All: Good night. Jonah: Hey, wait up. Wait up. Hey, I didn\\'t mean to... that, in there... I just wanted today to feel different than yesterday. Amy: Well, then you completely failed, because that exact same thing happened yesterday. But thank you. Jonah: Okay. Amy: I really do have to get going. See you at work tomorrow, Jonah? Jonah: You certainly will champ. Amy: Amy. Jonah: Nice to meet you, Amy. Garrett: Yo, you should come with us, man. We\\'re gonna throw some mannequin limbs in the dumpster and watch garbage men freak out. Jonah: That sounds awesome. Garrett: It is awesome. Come on. '"

JOSH  What bagel incident? FRANK If you ask her, I will stab you. LISA What do we want? TOOFER A coffee maker, coffee, and an array of milks. FRANK Three cases of name-brand soda a day. SARIE Cable tv. TOOFER A snack basket. yy JOSH LISA Josh, bend it, don't break it. LISA Gary will give us all this, right? PETE Of course he will. He's the nicest man in the world.

LISA Where's Gary? JACK Gary's dead. I'm Jack Donaghy. New VP of development for NBC/GE/Universal/Vivendi/ Kmart PETE We own Kmart now? JACK No, we don't. So why are you dressed like we do? SARIE Friday Night Bits. This is Sarie.  Mommy, why are you calling me? JOSH Are you guys just staring at the new receptionist or are you actually trying to levitate her with your minds? IOOFER Shhh, I have to hear this. SARIE Of course I showed up for work. You don't have to, like, check on me all the time. I  took the helicopter. FRANK Her parents are some rich famous big shots and they got her this job because they want her to learn the value of work. JOSH Who are her parents? FRANK She won't say. TOOFER She says it would affect the way we treat her. JOSH No, I would still try to make out with her.  FRANK She doesn't do it for me. My perfect woman is a standard size 12, still in her waitress uniform, with her kid asleep in the next room, KENNETH Rockefeller Center was built in the 1930's by--anyone? TOURIST The Rockefellers? KENNETH Correct. Studio 8E was constructed in 1951 for a show called \"The Vicks Vap-o- Rub Fun Hour.\" In the 1970's it was used for a talk show by a gentleman named Phil Donahoo. And now it's home to the Jenna DeCarlo-- TOURIST 6 Hey, that's Jenna DeCarlo! OTHERS Ooh, Jenna DeCarlo! Jenna! Etc.  JENNA Hi, let me explain that I'm really hung over right now and that's why I look like this. But I'm not normally hung over on a Wednesday. I tried a new tapas restaurant in my neighborhood last night and the waiter recognized me so he kept giving me free mojitos-- which doesn't happen all the time, I'm not like, some gross famous person-- but he kept bringing them and I don't usually drink hard liquor cause I'm really small and I can get drunk so easily-- I mean, I don't get drunk frequently. JENNA  I'm just saying that if I look a little green there are extenuating circumstances.  KENNETH How about that? Jenna DeCarlo, every-- JENNA But I don't want people to think I'm not friendly. I'm just nauseous and I have stomach issues-- JENNA  Okay. JENNA  Forget I said \"stomach issues.\" Okay. Bye.  PETE I'm surprised you're renovating. This is such a nice office. JACK It's a great office. But sometimes you have to change things that are perfectly good just to make them your own. JACK  call her back. Is she at the White House number? JACK  Tell them I need a 4 a.m. tee time. JACK  About five inches, but it's thick. JACK  Are you familiar with the award-winning GE Tri-vection oven? LISA I don't cook very much, JACK Sure. I got you. New York third wave feminist. College-educated. Single and pretending to be happy about it. Over- scheduled, under-sexed. You buy any magazine that says \"healthy body image\" on the cover, but your kitchen's got nothing but Snackwells and expired yogurts. You reject traditional female roles, but every two years you take up knitting for a week. PETE That's dead on. LISA Are you gonna guess my weight now? JACK You don't want me to do that. PETE That knitting thing is just uncanny. How do you do that? JACK Market research, my friend. Years and years of market research... that lead to my greatest triumph, the Tri-vection oven. PETE My wife wants one of those. JACK Yes, but I'il need my kevlar vest. The Trivection oven cooks perfect food five times faster than a conventional even, because it uses three kinds of heat: thermal technology, for consistent temperature; GE Precise Air™ convection technology, for optimal air circulation; and microwave technology, for unbelievable speed. With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey in 22 minutes. PETE Wow. That's impressive. JACK The people upstairs agree. That's why they promoted me. That's why I'm here to re-tool your show. LISA Re-tool what now? JACK I'm the new Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming. LISA That sounds like you program microwave ovens. JACK See, I told you that was imprecise. Make it \"Vice President of East Coast Television Programming and Microwave Oven- LISA Czar? JACK I like you. You have the boldness of a much younger woman. PETE You know, Jack, Lisa and I have worked together on a bunch of shows over the last ten years, and I know Gary was very pleased-- JACK Pete, I've seen the show. The littie gal's good. LISA Jenna. JACK And the skits are decent, but you're missing that third kind of heat. LISA There's the kind of heat that rises from dog poop. Maybe we could use that. JACK Think about Lawrence Jordan. PETE The black guy? JACK The black movie star. I flew with him recently on a private jet to the Super Bowl, and he was very entertaining. LISA Isn't he, um... crazy? JACK Lawrence has had his problems in the last few years. LAWRENCE I am a jedi! I ama jedi! JACK But it's important to remember that he was never charged with any crime. It's not illegal to fall asleep on your neighbor's roof. PETE Nor should it be. JACK Lawrence Jordan is the \"third heat.\" PETE So would he join the cast...? s JACK Join the cast, permanent guest host-- I'm going to meet with him this afternoon and see what he thinks-- JACK  What are you doing? LISA Sometimes when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it. LISA  \"This is not a dream.\" JACK Jonathan, take Pete and help him pick out a Trivection oven for his wife.  PETE  Hey. LISA Wait. LISA  We also want a coffee machine, a snack basket -- JACK Done. Jonathan? JACK  Lisa, I've heard a lot of good things about you, LISA Well, a lot of that stuff I don't do anymore. JACK I just want you to know that your job is secure. You're gonna be essential to transforming the show. LISA No, no, no, Jack. Jenna is my friend and we like our show the way it is. It may not get the highest ratings, but we have our own little following, and I'm not going to let you come in here and turn it into some kind of-- JACK Hit? LISA Just let me talk to her before you make any concrete-- LISA  Mother-effer-! JOSH Yes, I have an appointment with Louise. JENNA Glouise isn't here. I'm Bevergly. JENNA  And I'll be your substitute hair styglist!  IOOFER We should do one where \"Bevergly\" is a \"grape\" counselor. JOSH Just tell me who your parents are. SARIE No. You couldn't handle it. JOSH Okay, I'm gonna try to guess who they are from looking at your face. JOSH  Blond hair, little nose, kind of Swedish... Your mom is... Cheryl Tiegs and your dad is... Stephen Hawking. Sarie punches him in the arm. JOSH  What? Cause you're smart! PETE ...and Jenna DeCarlo was very upset. KENNETH I tried to read her face, but it's so rubbery!  PETE How bout this? As a rule, if you see a celebrity when you're with the tour group, do not bother them. KENNETH Is that a quideline, or a rule? Cause I respond well to structure. PETE Let's say it's a rule. LISA Hey. JENNA Hey. What happened to your head? LISA The sky is falling. Do you have a minute? JENNA No. I have a costume fitting for the \"Judgemental Baby\" sketch. LISA Ahh. I'11 find you after. JENNA You seem upset. LISA You seem upset. JENNA I'm hung over. LISA Remember, like, five years ago when you were still waitressing and I was temping at that law firm and we used to do improv shows for free at night? JENNA Yeah. LISA Did we hate it? JENNA Yeah. We hated it a lot. LISA That's what I thought. TOOFER Well done, m' lady! FRANK How'd you get everything so fast? LISA What can I say? I'm a hardass. PETE Well, my condolences. Please let me know where we can send flowers. Okay. PETE  Ugh, poor Gary. LISA How did he die? PETE Killed by a deer. LISA What?  PETE He used to feed the deer every morning at his house upstate. And then he got an injunction from the township saying he had to stop. So he did. Two days later, he goes out to get his paper, and the deer go mad. LISA They just went mad? PETE He stopped feeding them and they turned on him. LISA What are we gonna do? We quit, right? Do we quit? PETE Not me. My twins need braces. f LISA The older twins or the identicals? PETE All four. They've got mouths like piranhas. He hands her a picture from his desk. LISA Ew. They do. PETE But sometimes with a thing like this, if you wait it out, it goes away on its own. LISA No, you gotta get the braces. PETE Jack Donaghy, I'm talking about. So he meets with crazy Lawrence Jordan today. Jordan'11 ask for too much money or he'll show up wearing a child's swimsuit and a shower cap and Donaghy will change his mind. Nobody needs to know this ever came up. Josh enters. JOSH Oh, hey, awesome. Just the people I was looking for. I'm working on this bit about celebrities doing commercials, like-  \"This is Christopher Walken for Tropicana orange juice. Try the juice. It's very... tangy\" Or, um-- \"Yo, this is Lawrence Jordan, star of 'Black Cop/White. Cop' and when I want a good night's sleep, I sleep on my neighbor's roof. But now that I'm making a comeback, I sleep at the Best Western. Best Western. It's like sleeping on Ted Danson's roof. Holla!\" LISA Okay, I don't know what you've heard, but Lawrence Jordan is not joining the cast. He is not taking over for Jenna. We are not turning into The Lawrence Jordan Show. JOSH What? LISA Nothing. PETE Nicely handled. KENNETH Yes, Katie Couric is real tiny in person.  KENNETH  'But her boobs are a lot bigger than you would think. KENNETH  Now, if y'all look over here, you'll see a water fountain! KENNETH  Does anyone have any questions about it? Lawrence gives his posse a look like, \"What the heli? Why isn't this guy acknowledging me?\" LAWRENCE Yes, I have a question. How do you feel, NBC Tour? Cause you look like a portay! KENNETH Lawrence Jordan, everybody. LAWRENCE You're beautiful, little Mama. You're doing God's work. Don't I know you from the insurance meeting? We've got to sign those papers, Reginald.   LAWRENCE  Listen. I know being your age is hard. But don't you \"put on the trench coat.\" You hear me? You have a problem, you call me. Don't put on that trench coat. LAWRENCE  Live. Life. Love. Laugh! JOSH Does Jenna know? LISA I gotta tell her before she hears it somewhere else. JOSH She's been around the block. She can handle bad news. LISA Yeah... Off Lisa's look... JENNA  I said wheat toast. She bursts into tears.  LISA She's gonna freak out. TOOFER I will not work with Lawrence Jordan. PETE It's just a rumor. TOOFER I worked with him at the MTV awards two years ago, where he found it endlessly amusing to show me his johnson. PETE How was it? TOOFER Considerable. On one cccasion, he had placed it in a foot-long hot dog bun and put mustard on it. I loathe him. SARIE He's not that bad. He rents near us in East Hampton. I saw him once at a charity polo match. PETE Did he seem crazy? SARIE No. Well... he was making out with Martha Stewart...but we've all done that. Joking. TOOFER Have you seen any of his movies? The guy's sensibility is just cretinous. LISA I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters.  TOOFER \"Black Cop/White Cop\" LISA No. JOSH \"Who Dat Ninja?\" LISA No, he was... god, they all blend together, don't they? He had to pretend to be an old lady-- TOOFER Yes, yes. He actually says the title at one point... Off their thinking... LAWRENCE Oh, gracious goodness! You hooligans better watch out!  LAWRENCE  Cause this honky arandma be trippin! LISA/TOOFER \"Honky Grandma Be Trippin'.\" JOSH Oh, yeah. That movie was hilarious.  FRANK Is what I heard true?! PETE No! FRANK Gary Luderman got killed by a deer?! PETE Oh yeah, by the way, everybody. Gary Luderman got killed by a deer. JENNA You guys, you have to come see this! You know that crazy actor guy from \"Who Dat Ninja?\" He's in our studio! It's hilarious! You have to see it. LAWRENCE I'm back, America! I'm coming into your house. LAWRENCE  I'm coming into your house, America! JACK We love you, Lawrence! Come into our homes?  LAWRENCE I'm the third heat! I'm the third heat! JACK You're the third heat, baby! JENNA This guy's full-tilt nuts. Am I right? KENNETH Here we see the set for \"Friday Night Bits.\" JENNA What did he say? LISA Jenna, I have some news. Don't freak out. JENNA I am a jedi! I am a jedi!   LAWRENCE JORDAN Now at the time, me and Eddie were both talking to the same girl, 'cept I didn't know she was a transexual... Everyone laughs. LISA Will not one of you stand with me? LISA  Would you like me to review for you everything you've done wrong so far? You've hired a guy so crazy that nobody else in the world will work with him right now. You brought him in here without even talking to Jenna first, which will send her into a two-year spiral. You're putting him in my hands, knowing I don't want him here. You gave my greedy, insatiable writing staff every toy they asked for, which only means they will have a longer list of things they want tomorrow. Don't stop feeding those deer, Mr. Donaghy, or they will turn on you. JACK You'll make it work. LISA What makes you think that? JACK Cause your friend Jenna's got nowhere else to go. You'll be nice to Lawrence, cause it's not his fault. And you'll focus all your rage and hatred on me. LISA Ugh, you know what? You don't know everything about me. JACK About 127 pounds. LISA Hi, I'm Lisa. I'm-- LAWRENCE Yes, yes. Lisa Lemon! I know who you are. LAWRENCE  The very talented. Very talented. LISA Oh, well. Let's not. LAWRENCE You're gonna be my Phil Spector, right? LISA How's that? LAWRENCE You're gonna take my raw black sound and make it nice for white people's ears. LISA Yes. And then I'm gonna kill somebody. Lawrence thinks this is hilarious. LISA Hi, I'm here to pick up my baby. JENNA Tadeo, another mojito! LISA No, no. Come on, friend. Can I borrow this for five minutes? JENNA I have so much rage. LISA It could be worse. You could have nipple confusion. \n",
      " JAKE: This job is eating me alive. I can't breathe anymore. I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat. I'm not becoming like them. I am them.  AMY: Hey! What are you doing, weirdo?    JAKE: I'm doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco. Or actually, ten of me are doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco. 'Sup?  AMY: Get it together, man. Okay?   AMY: So the store was hit about two hours ago. They took mostly tablets, laptops, and cameras.    JAKE: Sorry.   AMY: I'd like a list of all your employees, whoever had access to the store. I'd also like to apologize for my partner. His parents didn't give him enough attention.  JAKE: Uh, Detective... I already solved the case. We're looking for three white males, one of whom has sleeve tats on both arms.  AMY: And how do you know that?  JAKE: I had an informant on the inside. He's been here for years. Watching, learning. Waiting. His code name?  Fuzzy Cuddle bear. He's a nanny cam.   AMY: You got lucky.  JAKE: No, I got here five minutes before you and figured that in this gigantic electronics store, there had to be at least one working camera. Oh! Hi, bad guys!  You did it, fuzzy. You busted 'em. It's time to come home.  JAKE:I'm not sure if I can. I've been undercover so long, I've forgotten who I am. I have seen terrible things. I haven't known the touch of a woman in many moons.  AMY: All right.  JAKE: Detective Santiago! Don't walk away from me!     JAKE: Yes, I did crack the case. So, Santiago, would you do the honors?   AMY: I hate this!  JAKE: Ah, yeah. And you're just gonna add one.    JAKE: I'm winning.    AMY: I hate this!  JAKE: It's a good feeling. It's a good feeling. Yeah.  AMY: Enjoy it while it lasts.  JAKE: I will!    TERRY: JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?   CHARLES: I think it was flan.  JAKE: Charles thinks it was flan. I think it was butterscotch pudding.    ROSA: Maybe it was just old person gunk. You know how old people always have that gunk on them.  JAKE: Oldie gunk. Could be, yeah. Anyone else?  TERRY: How about we focus on the murder and not the old person gunk?  AMY: Crime techs are at the scene now. We're heading back when they're done.  TERRY: Okay, I want you on this. It's gonna be priority one for the new C.O.  ROSA: Wait, tell us about the new Captain.  TERRY: Captain Holt will be here soon. He'll wanna introduce himself. Dismissed.    CHARLES: Hey, Gina. You know any scalpers? I wanna ask Rosa to go to the Rihanna concert with me, but it's sold out.   GINA: Okay, two points to make here. First, Rihanna... You... And then Rihanna.  CHARLES: Yeah. What's your second point?  GINA: She's got a type. Which is really anyone but you.  CHARLES: Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too.  GINA: Look, a Rihanna concert's a pretty big swing, man. I don't know. She's into watching old movies.  CHARLES: Cool. Where would I find a place that shows old movies?  GINA: Oh, yeah, just go on the Internet and search for the phrase \"I want to buy two movie tickets for a girl who doesn't like me.\"  CHARLES: Great. Thank you.  GINA: Good...   AMY: Hey, you heard anything about the new Captain?  JAKE: Uh, no, and I don't care. I just wish Captain McGintley never left, he was the best.  AMY: He was terrible. You just liked him 'cause he let you do anything you wanted.  JAKE: On your marks, get set...   MCGINTLEY: What the hell's going on around here?  JAKE: Fire extinguisher roller chair derby?  MCGINTLEY: Okay.   JAKE: And go!   JAKE: Yeah!   JAKE: What's your point?   AMY: If I'm ever gonna make Captain, I need a good mentor. I need my rabbi.  JAKE: Sorry, dude. But this new guy's gonna be another washed-up pencil pusher who's only concerned with  Following every rule in the patrol guide. Meep morp zeep. Robot Captain Engage.  MAN: Is that what you think?   JAKE: He-hey! New Captain alert. You must be the new C.O. I'm Detective Jake Peralta. Great to meet you.  HOLT: Now don't let me interrupt. You were describing what kind of person I'm gonna be. I'd like you to finish.  JAKE: That's not necessary. Or I could recap very quickly, sure. Um, let's see. I think I said some joke about being a washed-up pencil pusher.  HOLT: Now do the robot voice.  JAKE: Which-  HOLT: The robot voice you were doing when you implied I'm a rule-following robot. I wanna hear it again.  JAKE: Meep morp zarp. Robot.  HOLT: That's a terrible robot voice.  JAKE: Yep.  HOLT: The next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie.   JAKE: Oh, actually, the last Captain didn't care if we wore ties.  HOLT: Well, your new Captain does. And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders. Everyone, I'm your new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt.  AMY: Speech!  HOLT: That was my speech.  AMY: Short and sweet.  HOLT: Sergeant Jeffords, a word.  TERRY: Yes, sir.   AMY: I love that guy.  JAKE: Same!  GINA: He's so suave. Does anyone get a little bit of a gay vibe? No? Okay.     HOLT: Sergeant, you were in the 1-8 with me. Though you were significantly...  TERRY: Fatter, sir. They called me \"Terry Titties.\" Because I had large, uh...  HOLT: Titties, yes. I remember. I never liked that nickname. Though to be fair, it was accurate. What's this I hear about you being on administrative leave?  TERRY: A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls. Cagney and Lacey.  HOLT: They have adorable chubby cheeks.  TERRY: Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt. Lost my edge. There was an incident in a department store.   JAKE: Hey, man, you okay? You look a little jumpy.  TERRY: I'm fine. I'm fine.  JAKE: I think he's dead.   TERRY: And I'm still not right.  HOLT: Tell me about your Detective squad.  TERRY: Um... Well, Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels. They're pretty much worthless, but they make good coffee.  HOLT: Copy that.  TERRY: Now the good ones. Rosa Diaz.  Tough, smart, hard to read, and really scary.  ROSA: Tell me who has me for Secret Santa.  HITCHCOCK: No! That takes all the fun out of it.  HITCHCOCK: It's Scully. He got you a scarf. I'll make him return it.  ROSA: Yes, you will.  TERRY: Charles Boyle.  TERRY: He's a grinder. Not the most brilliant Detective, but he works harder than anyone else. He's not physically... gifted.  CHARLES: Oh, man! My muffin. Ahh! Oh, my head! My muffin, my head! And I stepped on the- On my muffin! And my head and my muffin.   TERRY: Amy Santiago.  TERRY: She's got seven brothers, so she's always trying to prove she's tough.  SCULLY: Careful. That stuff's pretty hot.  AMY: Oh, is it? Hmm?  TERRY: She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year. Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up.  HOLT: Tell me about Peralta.   TERRY: Jacob Peralta is my best Detective. He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.  HOLT: That was very well put.  TERRY: I've talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally mandated therapy sessions.  HOLT: Look, you know my history. You know how important this is to me. This precinct is doing fine, but I wanna make it the best one in Brooklyn. And I need your help.  TERRY: Absolutely, sir. Where do we start?  JAKE: What is happening?  HOLT: We start with him.   JAKE: Okay, so the perp came in through the window, Left the muddy red footprint, and apparently had sex with the dish rack.   AMY: Shell casing found here. Two shots. Bang, bang.   JAKE: Great work, Detective. You get a tie.   CHARLES: Hey, that's mine. You took it from my desk.  JAKE: That's right, Charles. Good solve. Tie for you.   CHARLES: Thanks!  JAKE: Now everyone be sure to put those on because it's impossible to solve crimes - unless you're wearing a tie.  AMY: Lay off the Captain. That man is gonna be my rabbi.  JAKE: Okay, first of all, when you use the word \"rabbi,\" you know that turns me on and that's unfair in the work environment. Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass.  CHARLES: Yeah, he's a little too serious. What do you think, Rosa?  ROSA: He seems cool.  CHARLES: Yeah, he seems cool. I agree.  ROSA: Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon Iberico ham, valued at what! dollar 6,000.  JAKE: dollar 6,000 for a ham?  CHARLES: Jamon Iberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain. They had it at my uncle's funeral. I gorged myself at that funeral. I mean, I was constipated for three days.  JAKE: Wow, that's a great story, Charles, thank you. All right, listen up, everybody. Better contact Captain Holt, let him know we got a ten-tie situation.  HOLT: Speaking of ties, where's yours, Meep Morp?   JAKE: This is fantastic. Captain! Hey! Welcome to the murder. What are you doing here?  HOLT: I like to know what my detectives are up to. That okay by you?  JAKE: Yep.  HOLT: Take Santiago and knock on doors. See if the neighbors heard anything.  JAKE: Door duty? It's a waste of time.  HOLT: Diaz and Boyle. Check in the coroner. Report back to me in an hour.  JAKE: That went well.  HOLT: No, it didn't.  JAKE: He's got like super hearing.  CHARLES: Hey, Rosa! Rosa. Rosa! Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week. Wanna go?  ROSA: Sure.  CHARLES: Cool! Awesome. There's a bunch of movie options.   CHARLES: I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.  ROSA: Citizen Kane is terrible. Pick a good movie.  CHARLES: Good call. Smart.  CHARLES: I'll do it. I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.  HOLT: So Gina. Civilian administrators like yourself often have their ear to the ground. What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?  GINA: I will tell you on six conditions. Number one, you let me use your office to practice my dance moves. Second-  HOLT: How about this? If you tell me-  GINA: Mm-hmm.  HOLT: I won't have you suspended without pay.  GINA: Oh, that sounds great. Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car. It's an old Mustang, and it's pretty sweet. If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him. He guarantees it will end in sex. I bet on at least some over-the-clothes action. At the very least, some touching-  HOLT: No, that's enough, Gina.  GINA: Caresses. I could see him showing up in a silk robe.  HOLT: That's enough, Gina.  GINA: All right.  HOLT: Thank you.  JAKE: Let the wasting of time begin.  AMY: Hello, sir. Can we ask you a few questions?  GUY: Definitely. Yeah. I'm actually I'm super glad you guys are here right now. Are you smelling that weed smell?  AMY/JAKE: Yeah.  GUY: Cause a dude broke in, smoked weed, and bolted.  JAKE: Do you think it's the same dude that left that bong there on the floor?  GUY: Yes?  Police!  Hello.  Hello.  What's your name?  My name?  Mm-hmm.  Mlepnos.  Can you spell that, please? M-l-e-p Clay.  Did you say \"Clay\"? Yes, the \"Clay\" is silent.  All right, got it.  Have you seen this man before? He was shot last night.  Oh.  Thank you.  No, sir, that's ours.  We need that.  - We - And he kept it.  Wall Street journal on the doormat Top floor apartment.  like a hot, eligible bachelor.  I'll take that action.  Police! Open up! Hello.  Oh! Hello, sir! How are you today? I am Detective Right-All-The-Time, and this is my partner Detective Terrible Detective.  No surprises from the coroner.  A few gunshots, shoulder and chest.  None of the neighbors heard or saw anything.  And what's worse, Santiago struck out with a 92-year-old.  That is not accurate, sir.  Wait, you hooked up with him? Ugh! All right, hit the pawn shops and canvass the neighborhood.  And while you're out, you can buy yourself a tie.  Oh, actually, sir I'm wearing a tie right now.  Check it out.  Secret tie.  First of all, I think you're kind of overdoing it with the manscaping.  But more importantly, Detective, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously? Does anyone here know why it's so important to me that you all dress appropriately? Hmm.  Four highly trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery.  I wanna be briefed on any new developments.  Any questions? I was gonna ask you if you thought I was doing too much manscaping, but we solved that one.  So I'm good.  Hey, Boyle.  Yep.  What about this fancy ham stuff? - Jamon Iberico.  Yes.  The perp left a really expensive TV but then stole ham? It doesn't make sense.  Is there a place nearby the crime scene that sells it? - Beneficio's might.Let's go.  You gotta brief the C.  O.  first.  We'll brief him after we catch the guy.  My name is Ratko.  I don't know anything.  Oh, okay.  You recognize this guy? - Henry Morgenthau? - No.  Maybe actually look at the picture.  I don't know him.  I don't know what happened.  No more questions.  Well, why don't I run a scenario past you, Ratko, and you tell me what you think? You do know Morgenthau.  He came in here and tried to sell you some hams.  You knew they were worth a lotta money, so you tried to steal them from him when he wasn't home.  Only he was home, so you shot him.  Does that sound familiar? Uh, maybe some role play will jog your memory? - Great idea.  Okay, yeah.  Okay.  So I'm I'm Ratko.  No, no, I'm Ratko.  Come on.  I'm always the victim.  Look, I'm doing this with you right here.  Fine, fine.  Oh! I'm Henry Morgenthau, owner of delicious and expensive hams.  Don't I know you from the grocery store? Kill! And scene.  NYPD! Everyone down! Ma'am, if you could just get down, or ignore me and continue shopping.  Boyle, get the door! - On it! Ratko! Oh! Ow! Ha ha ha! Ow, Ratko, ow! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Ratko! I'm getting mad! That's a waste of manchego! Charles! - How are you still here? - Jake! Little help! Ratko! He's not going anywhere, Jake! Ratko! I got him! I got him! Don't worry! So no, I did not brief you.  And yes, he did get away.  But some bonus good news I got you hazelnut.  And A little spoon there for you.  Is he seriously assigning me to the records room? I mean, why do we even have a records room? Computer's been invented, right? I didn't dream it? You're lucky, man.  I wish I could get assigned here full-time.  You could not be farther from the action.  Sergeant, you know me.  I have more arrests than anyone.  Will you please tell the Captain how dumb it is to lock his best Detective in a file cabinet? - Second best.  - You're wrong about Holt.  That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you will ever know.  In 1981, he caught the disco strangler.  It's over, disco man! Put down the yo-yo and back away from the girl.  Wow.  The man is the real deal.  You need to listen to him.  Gonna be hard to win our bet when you're on the bench, Peralta.  Although I did start a new category.  \"Murderers we let go.\"  And look at that.  You're winning.  Have fun with your files.  Yeah, you know what, I will have fun with my files.  Have fun with your face! Slam! That was a slam.  So what movie did you get us tickets to? Oh, well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them.  Just to be safe? What does that mean? I don't know, I didn't wanna mess up.  Because you're sort of Opinionated.  You think I'm opinionated? Okay, here's an opinion for you.  You're a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit.  So we can go see North by Northwest.  We're not seeing a movie together.  Good call.  Smart.  Keep it profesh.  Hey, Captain.  So you found something? Hey, I like the tie.  If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  Anyway, I think I got something good here.  Turns out the name \"Ratko\" is made up.  But I was digging through these files One of which I literally found in a spider web And it turns out there were a bunch of references to a serbian thug, street names \"the rat\" and \"the butcher,\" who's known to hang out at a storage unit near Boerum Park, which has red soil, hence, the muddy red footprint on Morgenthau's counter.  That's fine work, Detective.  Thank you very much, sir.  Testament to what can be achieved when you dress appropriately.  Let's pound it out.  You know what, such fine police work, let's share it with the whole team.  Santiago! Boyle! Diaz! Get in here! Bring everyone! And a camera! That's not necessary.  Oh, they're here! Of the fine master Detective, Jake Peralta.  Yeah, let's have a hand, everyone.  Give him a hand.  Yeah, nice! Looking good! Yeah.  Thank you.  No record of Ratko on the ledger.  Must've used cash.  Well, I, for one, am just pumped to be on a stakeout with you, Captain.  You know what my favorite thing about stakeouts is? Patrol guide says \"no dress code.  \" So I'm just the zip-up hoodie and my two best friends.  Does he always talk this much? I just tune it out.  It's like a white noise machine.  Okay, first of all, that's racist.  Secondly, Captain, Terry told me you caught the disco strangler.  That's incredible.  I've read that case.  With all due respect, sir, why'd it take you so long to get your first command? Because I'm gay.  Ah.  Seriously? I'm surprised you didn't know.  I don't try to hide it.  Did anyone else get a little bit of a gay vibe? Manscaping.  Damn! I am not a good Detective.  Here.  I feel bad that you spent all that money on the movie tickets.  Why don't you just go to the movies with me? Nope.  Okay.  Well, this is awkward.  It's not awkward.  I like your company.  You're sweet.  When did you come out? About 25 years ago.  The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay Detective.  But then the old guard died out.  Suddenly, they couldn't wait to show off the fact that they had a highly ranking gay officer.  I made Captain.  But they put me in a public affairs unit.  I was a good soldier.  I helped recruitment.  But all I ever really wanted was my own command.  And now I finally got it.  And I'm not gonna screw it up.  Captain, I'm sorry.  I I feel like a jackass.  But on the flip side, there's Ratko.  Humility over.  I'm amazing! Fantastic.  Looks like we all got door duty.  Ah, yeah.  From before.  Good one.  You look great.  Clear.  Clear.  Okay.  Unbelievable! Un-believable! Ah.  Ratko, great to see you.  You can't stop me.  I'm going.  Actually, you're not going anywhere.  'Cause if you take a look to your left, you'll see Detective's Boyle and Diaz.  Right there is Detective Santiago.  And behind you is Captain Holt.  Point is My team has you surrounded.  Oh, my God, I just got the tie thing! Captain, I just figured it out.  Maybe now's not the best time, Detective.  It's a uniform! We're a team, and the tie is a part of that team's uniform, right? You ask Ratko what team? No, Ratko, shut up.  It's important to you because you were kept off the team for so long.  And now you're the coach, and you want us to all wear that same uniform.  Boom! Nailed it! Yes, you did.  Now just arrest Ratko.  All right, Ratko, down.  Drop the weapon.  Hands on your head.  Here we go.  - Hey! - He's running! Oh! Got him! Hands behind your back! Hands behind your back! Stay down.  That's how we do it in the nine-nine, sir.  Catch bad guys and look good doing it.  What's wrong with you? Never took off the speedo.  Big mistake.  It is inside me.  Great work, team!  \n",
      "DENNIS Another big night, fellas. One Hundred eighty four dollars and sixty-seven cents. MAC Jesus Christ. CHARLIE On a Thursday night? DENNIS And our mortgage is due in two weeks. MAC Didn't we just pay that goddamn thing like a week ago? DENNIS Yes, Mac. And a week ago we were three weeks late. CHARLIE What are we gonna do? DENNIS I don't know, Charlie. But, then again, I don't know why I got into business with you boners in the first place, so I'm probably not the right person to ask. MAC Dennis, take it easy. DENNIS Take it easy? If we don't start making some money, we're gonna lose the bar. CHARLIE We are not gonna lose the bar. MAC Let's not get hysterical, please. SWEET DEE  Alright, listen.

MAC Good. Good, man. Silence. TERRELL Guess you guys don't have a lot of brothers walking in here, huh? DENNIS No man! MAC That's not it! DENNIS That's not it at all! CHARLIE We have plenty of brothers...black people... DENNIS African American. African American people coming in all the time. MAC You might know some of them... TERRELL Yeah, we're probably related. MAC No, that's not what I meant. I wasn't implying that you're all related. DENNIS He wasn't implying- MAC It was just that Sweet Dee said that, uh... CHARLIE We weren't expecting Dee to... MAC We just didn't expect you to be black.  TERRELL Right. SWEET DEE Thanks guys.  TERRELL I'm promoting you better believe it's gonna be everybody and their momma trying to get in. White boys, brothas, Latinos, whatever. We got niggas hanging from the rafters! CHARLIE Absolutely. TERRELL So we got like four hundred plus packed into this place. DENNIS Four hundred?! TERRELL No joke. And it's mostly college kids. My sista goes to Temple and she's got the hookups there. MAC Hookups are good. Point of clarification. When you say \"sista\", you mean... TERRELL I mean my sister. MAC Great. It's just that sometimes it could mean your friend, or you know- CHARLIE Mac, shut up. TERRELL SO we all packed into this tiny little place on Walnut. We like half way through the night, everything's goin' fine when all of a sudden, I see this dude eye ballin me from across the bar. And I'm like, you know, I don't know if this dude wants to freak me or fight me, you know what I'm sayin'? MAC Totally! CHARLIE This dude's givin' you crazy eyes! TERRELL So, I walk over to the dude. He's this big, cut, Mexican mofo. And I'm like Yo' esse, unless you wanna get yo' ass torn apart yo betta get that look off yo' face. MAC You just walked right up to him and said that? TERRELL I had to make the first move, son. Always make the first move! MAC Badass. SWEET DEE So what happened? TERRELL This dude, just kept staring me down. So we like eye ball to eye ball. I'm three inches from this dude's grill. It feels like eternity, son! Then he finally opens his mouth...and says: \"I guess you gonna have to tear my ass apart then, holmes.\" MAC Oh shit. SWEET DEE Oh my God. What did you do? TERRELL I had no choice... I took him to the back alley... and I tore his ass apart. SWEET DEE Wow. MAC You are the man! MAC  I love that guy!

That's not what I meant. CHARLIE I'il get the coffee. What do you guys want? DENNIS Dude, just wait until the waitress comes out here. You can stare at her then.  CHARLIE I wasn't going to stare at her. DENNIS Sure you weren't. It's pathetic, Charlie, you're totally obsessed with that chick. CHARLIE I am not. DENNIS It's never gonna happen, dude. MAC Hey, we should totally hire Terrell! DENNIS I don't know. MAC Dude, you heard him. When he's promotin', everybody and they mommas are lookin' to get in. CHARLIE Yeah. They have niggers hanging from rafters. WAITRESS Wow. Nice. CHARLIE No, I was quoting- I was quoting a black...great, now she thinks I'm racist. DENNIS I thought you said you weren't into her. CHARLIE I'm not. It's just...that, I don't want her thinking that. MAC Den, let's give Terrell a shot. If he delivers half of what he promises, we're looking at like two hundred people. DENNIS It would be nice to actually get some chicks into Paddy's. Alright, let's give him a shot. CHARLIE You sure about this? MAC It's two thousand five, Charlie. Don't you think it's a damn shame that you have no friends outside of your own race. CHARLIE So what are you planning to do? MAC We're gonna go in there and try to diversify. Make friends with people of other cultures, you know, broaden our horizons. CHARLIE You just wanna impress Terrell with new black friends. MAC Charlie. Don't be a dick. DAMON I'm a bust that shit up, Reese. I'm a bust that shit up!  MAC Eventually, the attention is taken off Mac, and the game resumes. MAC Sort of a hostile environment. Maybe we need to rethink this. KAREN Hey. What's your name? CHARLIE Charlie. KAREN Do you play bones, Charlie? CHARLIE I dabble. KAREN Do you wanna play? I could get you a game. CHARLIE I really shouldn't. I'm not very good.

What am I supposed to say in that situation? JANELLE Hey. I'm Janelle. CHARLIE Hey. JANELLE You got nice moves, Charlie. CHARLIE Oh. Thanks. Janelle slips him a piece of paper. JANELLE I wanted to give you this. Give me a call sometime. CHARLIE Yeah, okay, sure.  MAC What are you doing, dude? CHARLIE What? MAC How could you blow that chick off? That chick is gorgeous and it's like the perfect opportunity to prove we are not racist. CHARLIE Well, I think, if anything, we should be focused on black men. MAC What the hell are you talking about? You've gotta call this girl. CHARLIE She's not really what we need. We need black guys. wa Guys? Why does it have to be guys? MAC  Is this about that waitress? CHARLIE What? No. MAC It's never gonna happen, dude. You've gotta stop with this shit. CHARLIE I don't care about that. MAC Let me see your wallet. CHARLIE Why?

I'll call her.  SWEET DEE I had the strangest dream last night. I was in Cleveland, Ohio, which is really funny cause I've never been to Ohio. DENNIS I don't want to hear about your dreams, Dee. I hate listening to people's dreams. It's like flipping through a stack of photographs I'm not in. I don't care. TERRELL Yo, wassup? Sweet Dee instantly sweetens.  SWEET DEE Hey! DENNIS Hey, Terrell, how you doing? TERRELL Come here. I wanna show you somethin'. TERRELL Rule number one. Always keep a line. DENNIS This is crazy! SWEET DEE I told you! Terrell is the best!

CHARLIE Lotta dudes. DENNIS Yeah. Lotta dudes. MAC Ton of dudes. HANDSOME GUY Excuse me, bartender? SWEET DEE What can I get you boys?  HANDSOME GUY We'd actually like to wait for the other one. SWEET DEE What other one? CHARLIE Hey, Mac isn't that your Brett? cousin, MAC Yo, Brettty Boy! BRETT Hey, cuz! MAC What's going on, dude?! CHARLIE Hey, Brett. Do you believe this? It's crazy, right? BRETT It's something else! DENNIS Gentlemen, I understand my services have been requested. HANDSOME GUY I have a couple of services I'd like to request. DENNIS Whoa! Hey, what are doing? HANDSOME GUY You have the most beautiful eyes. DENNIS I'm not...I just- Really? You think SO? HANDSOME GUY So blue. DENNIS It's more of a blue-green actually. SWEET DEE  Dennis! DENNIS Could you excuse me for a sec? SWEET DEE You getting a strange vibe in here? DENNIS Yup. BRETT Did you guys put this party together yourself? MAC No we had a promoter. BRETT I just had to see it for myself. CHARLIE What do you mean? BRETT You guys own the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia. SWEET DEE How could you not tell me you were gay?! TERRELL I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia. I didn't think it was a big secret. SWEET DEE But, I've been coming on to you for weeks ! TERRELL I just thought you were into gay dudes. SWEET DEE I am not into gay dudes. TERRELL Apparently you are. SWEET DEE Well, the guys hired you to promote for them and you turned their bar into a gay bar. They're totally pissed! DENNIS  Nine thousand, five hundred, fifty- three dollars and sixty-seven cents!  CHARLIE In one night! DENNIS We made more money in one night than in the entire year we've owned this place. CHARLIE This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to us! I think we should totally embrace the situation. DENNIS Me too! CHARLIE I'm a little worried about Mac. DENNIS I wouldn't worry about Mac. He can be quite open-minded. MAC No goddamn way. MAC Have you seen this? MAC \"Looking for that new hot spot to spot that stud? Well, Paddy's Irish Pub has plugged that hole.\" CHARLIE That's a nice notice. MAC No it's not! I don't want to he plugging any holes.  SWEET DEE I agree with Mac on this one. DENNIS Of course you do. I made three hundred dollars in tips last night. How much did you make? SWEET DEE That's not the point! DENNIS Sure it isn't, Dee. CHARLIE I don't think we have much of a choice. MAC If you assholes recall, one of the reasons we bought that shit hole in the first place was to get laid! CHARLIE Maybe all you wanted was to get laid, but I, my friend, have a little something called business ethics. MAC Shut up, Charlie. The only reason you don't care is because you have black girls hanging all over you. But you know what, dude? You're gonna screw it up. CHARLIE Screw it up? I'm sorry, my friend, but I actually have a date with one of them today. DENNIS Look, Mac, It's a purely fiscal decision, SWEET DEE That's bullshit, Dennis. This has nothing to do with money. You just like all the attention. DENNIS What's that supposed to mean?  SWEET DEE You know exactly what I mean pretty boy. GUY Hey, handsome. GUY 2 Hey, beautiful. GUY 3 Hey, sexy. GUY 4 Hey, gorgeous. DENNIS Hay. DENNIS I just get along with those guys. SWEET DEE You're leading them on! You're not gay! You're just vain! CHARLIE All in favor of Paddy's remaining the hottest gay bar in Philly say, \"Aye we .  CHARLIE/DENNIS aye. CHARLIE Opposed- DENNIS -Keeping in mind that you're only the bartender Dee, and not an owner, so you don't get a vote. MAC She gets a vote! SWEET DEE I get a vote! CHARLIE Opposed? MAC Nay. Aww, this is bullshit! CHARLIE The Aye's have it! Paddy's Irish Pub will remain the hottest gay bar in Philly.  CHARLIE Wow. You look great. JANELLE Thanks, Charlie. So, where to? CHARLIE I thought we'd go grab a drink. JANELLE Oh. A coffee shop. Okay... I thought you meant like a drink at a bar.   CHARLIE Yeah, absolutely. Let's sit here. go up. What can I get you? JANELLE I don't really drink coffee. CHARLIE Totally. Charlie walks up to the waitress at the counter. WAITRESS What do you want, Charlie? CHARLIE I'd like you to take a look at the beautiful African American girl sitting at that table there. WAITRESS Okay? CHARLIE That woman is my friend. WAITRESS Good for you. CHARLIE So, you see, the other day, when you heard me saying something about \"people\" hanging from rafters- WAITRESS What do you want? CHARLIE Maybe now that you know I am not racist, maybe we could- WAITRESS Dude. N.O. How many times am I going to have to say it? JANELLE What's going on over here? WAITRESS Charlie's using you to prove he's not racist. Then he asked me on a date. JANELLE Charlie? Is this true? CHARLIE Well- SWEET DEE I think you should see a doctor, Charlie. This looks bad. CHARLIE I already went. He told me Janelle almost cracked my skull. SWEET DEE Just make sure you keep this thing- wait, what did you say this girl's name is? CHARLIE Janelle. Jenkins. She told me if she ever saw me again she'd slit my throat. I believe her. SWEET DEE And you met her at Temple? CHARLIE Yeah. Sweet Dee realizes something. MAC Are you two seeing this? DENNIS The boys are out tonight, huh?! They stare in horror. MAC This is unbelievable. You've got black women crawling all over you. And this Mary over here is the belle of the ball. Why do these people like you guys so much? CHARLIE It's not that they like us, Mac. It's that they don't like you. Nobody likes you. Because you're an asshole. Charlie walks off. MAC Is that true? SWEET DEE Yeah, kinda. Listen, we need to talk.  SWEET DEE This girl that Charlie's talking about from Temple, Janelle Jenkins? I know her. MAC So what? Sweet Dee smiles. SWEET DEE I think I know how to make things normal around here. Okay, first off we need to deal with Dennis. I want you to get him wasted tonight. Blackout wasted. You feed him enough tequila to kill a horse. Can you do that? MAC No problen. Sweet Dee heads for the door. MAC Where are you going? SWEET DEE I need to talk to a couple of friends from my acting class. Then I'm going up to Temple. Just make sure Dennis gets hammered. Black out hammered.  MAC I'm pretty sure the lime goes first. DENNIS No, dude, the salt's first. MAC Nope. It's the lime. DENNIS Watch. DENNIS There. You see? MAC So you do the shot first? Wait a second, do it again. DENNIS You're pathetic, dude.   DENNIS Oh my God. He looks around. DENNIS  Where the hell am I? DENNIS  Hey now? DENNIS  Nice. DENNIS  Very nice. BOY Hey lover. DENNIS Whoa! No! No! This is not...I don't....what happened here? BOY What do you mean? DENNIS What's going on!? What happened here? BOY Relax stud. You got nothing to be ashamed about. DENNIS What the hell are you...did we...did we have... BOY No silly. DENNIS Oh my God. Thank God. BOY It was all hands. LARGE MAN IN TOWEL Hey! My boys are up! LARGE MAN IN TOWEL  How's that ass feeling? CHARLIE  I'm really glad you decided to embrace this, Mac.  MAC Yeah, me too. CHARLIE I really just think this is a great business decision. MAC Yeah. I guess I just decided that you guys were right. I think owning a gay bar is a great idea.  DENNIS I don't wanna own a gay bar anymore. CHARLIE What?! MAC Oh no. What happened? DENNIS I've just been doing some thinking and I feel like we had our little experiment but it's time to go back to normal. MAC You're done experimenting? All done with the experiments? DENNIS With the bar. The experiment with the bar. CHARLIE But Terrell's helping us redecorate. He's really pumped.  TERRELL Hey, Dennis. I brought some new music for the jukebox. The stuff you guys have in there's a little dated. Now, I think the first thing we do is get rid of all these shamrocks. DENNIS Terrell we have to talk.  phone. MAC  Everybody's here. SWEET DEE Alright, we're right outside.  TERRELL I don't understand. I thought you guys were happy. MAC Dennis had his experiment and changed his mind. DENNIS With the bar, dude! Stop saying it like that. TERRELL I think you guys are being ridiculous. CHARLIE Me too! I thought we were trying to be open minded! I thought we wanted to expand our horizons! SWEET DEE Hey, everybody! MAC Hey, Dee! Look, everybody! Sweet Dee's here! JANELLE Charlie? CHARLIE Oh shit! JANELLE What the hell are you doing here? CHARLIE Look, okay, I said I was sorry! You smashed my face, what else do you want?! TERRELL Janelle?  JANELLE Terrell? What the hell you hangin' out with this dickhead for? DENNIS What's going on? MAC Do you two know each other? CHARLIE This is the bitch that cracked my skull! TERRELL Charlie. This is Janelle.  My sister. CHARLIE Your sister? TERRELL Yeah. MAC Point of clarification. Your \"sista\"? TERRELL My sister. MAC Right! MAC So you're actually related? TERRELL Yeah. MAC Ha! Earlier you were implying that I was racist because you thought that I was implying that all black people are related and then it turns out that you people actually are. MAC I mean you people. You two. Not all black people. SWEET DEE Mac, shut up. TERRELL I quit. BLACK.  SWEET DEE One hundred twenty nine, one hundred thirty... one hundred + thirty one dollars and twenty cents. MAC On a Saturday night. SWEET DEE Not bad. MAC So, Dee-- I have to know... what exactly did you tell your friends from acting class to say to Dennis that get him so freaked out? SWEET DEE Oh, I forgot to tell you - that didn't work out. MAC What? SWEET DEE Yeah, I couldn't get a hold of them. MAC So why was he so freaked out? SWEET DEE I don't know... They consider this for a moment as we:   \n",
      "Mindy: You have an idea of how your life is going to turn out. When I was a kid, all I did was watch romantic comedies in our living room while I did my homework.  \"I'll have what she's having.\" Some coffee or, you know, drinks? Mindy: In High School, Tom Hanks was my first boyfriend. \"For as long as we both shall live.\" Mindy: In college, everything changed. No supervision, total freedom. I could watch romantic comedies whenever I wanted to. \"I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her.\" Mindy: And then two years ago, when I finally became a doctor, I had no time for any distractions. You are 8 1/2 months pregnant. Your husband's gotta keep his schvantz away from you. Which I can imagine must be difficult with a wife as beautiful as yours. She's already pregnant, Dr. Reed. Idiot. I am going to put Dr. Castellano in charge. He's my best resident. Dr. Castellano. Daniel Castellano. I'm the man that's gonna take a person outta you. I don't take that responsibility lightly, okay? Shulman: You're scaring them, Danny. Danny: Sorry. Sorry, ma'am. Don't be frightened.  Mindy: And that's when I saw him.  Oh, my God. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry. Sorry. No way. Thanks. It's happening. The doors are closing. I just love when the elevators start to do their thing. Oh. Never thought about that. I guess I do too. Oh, my God. Sorry. Oh, here, let me help you with that stuff. Sorry. Oh.  Klutzes, party of two. Seriously. Mindy: Met in an elevator. My hair came undone. Are you kidding me? I'm basically Sandra bullock. And then it happened. Did the elevator just stop? I'm Mindy. Obstetrics and gynecology. Tom. Oral surgery. Can I get you an orange? Mindy: We were stuck in the elevator for 20 minutes... I have a sandwich here. Mindy: And I moved into his apartment two months later. What does this have to do with the circumstances of your arrest? I am getting to that. Tom got married last night to someone else. Mindy: Three months ago, he met and fell in love with some serbian girl who sells bagels in the lobby of the hospital. He fixed her teeth, dumped me, and last night, they got married. I don't think they thought I would ever go, so they invited me to be polite. But, oh, I did go. And after four vodka sodas, I realized I had something to say. Some of you might not know that Tom and I used to date. So I have some pretty good stories about everyone's favorite glorified dentist.  Like how Tom will always cover his ears and go, \"ahh,\" if you start talking about an episode of TV that he has not seen yet. God forbid you give away the ending to Downton abbey. What the hell is this show, and why does everybody keep talking about it? Shh. Why can't I talk? Or the time that Tom told me, um, when we were having sex that he wanted to marry me and make me pregnant with six babies. Did you guys know about that? Which I really wanted too. Hey... But that didn't end up happening 'cause I think I was too old. No, I mean, I know that I was too old. That's what you said to me. Not what I said. When you broke up with me. Sorry, you said you wanted to build a future with someone with more years to share. That is what I said. Doesn't matter, because here you are, getting married to the serbian bagel girl. By the way, are we 100% sure that she is not a w*r criminal? Don't look at me like that. Am I the only person here who saw Angelina jolie's movie? She's not a w*r criminal. Whatever, you guys. I'm so happy for you. I only want the best for the two of you. One of you. Let's wrap it up. L'chaim!  Everyone, great talking to you. Huh! Great, awesome. Thank you. Brilliant. I'm Sandra bullock!   r*cist! Ooh, a shortcut. Aah! Mindy. Mindy, down here. I've been waiting for you. Can I tell you something, girl to girl? You are acting like a  idiot. If you don't pull it together, no one will ever love you. At least I have a boyfriend. Mindy: And when that hot, mean doll pointed out that even she had a boyfriend, I just started to cry. This is not where I should be. It's important for you to know that this is not really who I am. Or who I have been is not who I'm going to be. We have you down for three counts of public intoxication, theft, and disorderly conduct. I'm sorry, disorderly conduct? Aren't there rapists and m*rder out there? When you are disorderly, you are a r*pist of peace and quiet. That's a little... okay. She's been bailed out. Gwen, my hero. It has been great working with you and seeing this process from the inside. Before I leave, would it be possible to get a tour of the special v*ctim unit?  No? Okay, bye. Gwen: Did you think that Tom was just gonna ditch the wedding and run off with you like you're Katherine Heigl? Kind of, yes. Well, your life is not a romantic comedy. Right now it seems more like a sad documentary about a criminally insane spinster. It kinda sounds like I could win an Oscar though. I think I should cancel that date tonight with Dennis. Gwen, no. Listen, I'm just being real with you. Carl and I know, like, three datable guys that we can set friends up with, and I can't squander them on a high-risk situation like this. Okay, I promise you, Gwen, this drunk, crime-committing person, she's history. There's no reason for me to live my life like this. I went to a good college, I am a doctor. This is boring. My body mass index is not great, but I'm not, like, precious or anything, you know? This is boring. You know what, you are boring. Contribute something. Don't call my daughter boring. Honey, you're fascinating. Hmm. Listen, Gwen, I cannot keep hooking up with Jeremy and then later asking him, \"hey, what's our deal anyway?\" That British guy, he is bad news. We do not know that he is bad news. I think he has a good heart. I think he's Hugh grant in about a boy. I think that he is Hugh grant in real life. Mindy? I hate to interrupt because I see you're enjoying some well-deserved BFF time. Hello, Gwendolyn. Hi. Your patient, Allison silverman, is going into labor. The one with insurance? Oh, hell yes, okay. Bye, guys. Gotta go. Love you. Bye, love you.  Man: Hey! It's fine. I'm a doctor! Medical emergency!  Congratulations. There you go. I'm on call. So you delivered my patient? You're welcome. May I say you look great? Sorry, Danny, I didn't have time to get dolled up for you because I was kind of busy freeing myself from wrongful imprisonment. Wrongful? My God, you think they'll ever catch the real drunk girl who fell into the pool? That's hilarious. But I guess it's not hilarious when you get arrested for as*ault at a Bruce Springsteen concert. First of all, it's a Springsteen show, not a Bruce Springsteen concert. You sound ignorant. Second of all, you don't show up at a Springsteen show wearing a John cougar mellencamp t-shirt unless you want to get punched in the face. How did I get into this Springsteen-mellencamp conversation again? Oh, and Mrs. silverman asked if I'd be her doctor from now on, and I said yes. Are you kidding me? So now you're stealing my patient? It's not stealing if she wanted to go. Leave her alone, Danny. She's had a rough night. And whose fault is that? Everyone loses it at weddings. They're designed to exploit our sentimental side. Thank you. I agree with that. I can't recall a wedding where I didn't end up in the arms of some woman I met that night. And not because she was vulnerable. 'Cause I was. You know, I used to think that sex addiction was made up by male celebrities, but now I think it's real. That's not cool. Yes, yeah, I love sex. I do it a lot. I do it well. But I'm not addicted to it. I'm addicted to attention. That is so interesting. Listen, I'm all for lonely people making connections, but this is the doctors' lounge, not the wooded area behind the highway rest stop, all right? I mean, really, guys, I hate that I can't read the newspaper in here anymore. Yeah, we get it, Danny. You read the newspaper. You're so much smarter than us. We get it, Danny. You're so much smarter than us. I am though. I'm smarter than you. You look so trashy right now. I know. I'm sorry. No, I love it. Do you wanna hang out? We are hanging out. Let's hang out deep. Oh, God. Sorry, thank you for the offer. What? I want to. You should. And I can't. Okay. You're gorgeous. Okay, I gotta go. I gotta go. This sucks. I hate my life. Take that trashiness with you.

And I really, really want to help you. It's just that I'm at this point in my life where I can't just do what I want to do. You know, I have to do things that really move my life forward. Like... like spinning. Do you guys know what that is? We won't tell anybody. Still, people could find out. How? Um, let's see, I talk a lot. You know, like in my sleep, on a date. I drink a lot. So I just, I can't control it.  Okay, okay, okay, look, look. I will take you on as a patient, but you just need to look me in the eye and promise me that you will have health insurance by the time she delivers. But I can't promise it. I don't know if it's true. It doesn't have to be true. I just need to hear it. I do this with guys all the time. I promise we will have insurance. Great, thank you. Welcome. Hey, you two, quick question. Do you care about my career and want me to succeed? More than anything in the world. Okay, well, if that is the case, why are you sending me non-english-speaking pregnant immigrants with no health insurance, with literally, like, burkas and stuff? I thought she might be rich with oil money. Well, she wasn't. She was poor with nothing money. Well, why wouldn't you just tell her no? Because I am not good at saying no. Okay, one time I left a flea market with a samurai sword. I just... I need a different kind of patient. More white patients, done. Well, don't write that.  But yes. So do you guys want to see an amazing first-date outfit? Yes. For sure. Oh, my gosh! I mean, I don't know. Wow. Gotta give it up, you look hot. Thank you for giving it up, shauna. Okay. Boy. I can hear you. What? That's not a good date outfit. What are you talking about? It's glamorous, and it's awesome. Girls may like that stuff, but guys don't. Um, I think I know what guys like. Maybe. Is your date with Elton John on new year's Eve?  That's not funny. That is insensitive to gay men and to me. Morning, everybody. Good morning. Dr. shulman, do you like my outfit? It's glitzy. Got razzle-dazzle, like a fishing lure. But do you like it? Danny, you know, I like it because she likes it so much. Mindy, what's the occasion? First date. First date? Exciting. Remember, you're worth waiting for. He hates it. He didn't say that. Anyway, that's just my two cents, but what do I know? I'm just a wealthy, single heterosexual male. Well, what do you think she should wear, Dr. Castellano? She didn't grow up in this country. Actually, I did grow up in this country, Betsy. Thank you. Oh. But answer the question. Easy, tight dress, shoes that won't make you complain about walking two blocks. Not a lot of makeup. Look hot. Keep it simple. Okay, thank you. Sure. I'm just gonna take fashion advice from...  Danny Castellano. You're welcome. 'Cause Danny Castellano, he really gets women, you know? I do, don't I? Just ask his wife. Oh, I'm sorry, his, um, ex-wife. You know what would really look great? Yeah? What? If you lost 15 pounds. What? Do you wanna get smacked? No, I don't wanna get smacked, Dr. Lahiri, not in my place of work. I want to peacefully go about my day.

No, I mean, like, was he a man? Danny, don't just repeat it and expect me to understand what you're saying.

Is this the kinda guy who is gonna get grossed out when you give birth, or is he gonna dry your forehead and tell you you look beautiful while all that disgusting stuff is coming out of you?

      "LESLIE   I love politics. I've always loved  politics. \"The game.\"  LESLIE   Some people say that politics is show  business for ugly people. I disagree.  It's show business for real people --  people whose talents aren't dancing and  singing, but rather talking and talking.  LESLIE   I just...I love the majesty of the  political system. I live for it. I  would say that my greatest dream is to be  elected President of the United States of  America.  LESLIE  My name is Leslie Knope. And I am the  Deputy Chairwoman of the Department of  Parks and Recreation in the city of  Pawnee, Indiana.   LESLIE   Can you get wide enough to see the flag?  RON  Internal Auditing wants to remind all  government employees that any gift given  by a member of the public valued at over  dollar 25 has to be reported immediately.  EMPLOYEE  Ron, what about, like, a gift  certificate? Would that count?  RON  How much?  EMPLOYEE  Two hundred dollars.  • RON    ...Yes. That would count. You can't win, just  report it and add to the endless red tape.  LESLIE  Of course report it!    It's the smart play. The last thing we need is the  press breathing down our neck. Am I right, Ron? I  am agreeing with you.   RON  Lastly, tonight is the Community Outreach Public  Forum. Leslie's gonna run it.  RON    We need one more. Who wants in?  • RON   Tom. TOM  Ugh. Fine.  LESLIE  Every month the city government holds a  public forum and every month, out of over  600 city workers, I'm the one they send.    It's pretty cool. Whatever. No big  deal. Just an honor.  RON  No one else wants to do it. It's a  terrible job, going to some dingy rec  center and getting yelled at by the  public. I hate the public. The public  is stupid.  LESLIE  This'll be really good for you guys to  see. This is where the rubber of  government meets the road of actual human  beings. When I go through those doors, I  have to be on, like the White House Press  Secretary. So. Deep breath.  Let's rock and roll.   LESLIE  Thank you all for coming. My name is  Parks Department Deputy Chairwoman Leslie  Knope.  LESLIE   With me today is department member Tom  Haverford.  TOM TALKING HEAD  TOM  Yes, when I was 18 I changed my name from  Aziz Abdul A1'Rahman to Tom Haverford.  The cold hard fact is that dark-skinned  people with funny-sounding Muslim names  just don't make it very far in politics.    Yes, okay, fine, Barack Obama. Why does  everyone always bring up Barack Obama?  That's one counter-example!  LESLIE   And yes, I do call myself a \"Deputy  Chairwoman.\" Politics is changing in  this country -- it's not just a boys club  anymore. There are 18 million cracks in  the glass ceiling, thanks to people like  me, and Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin,  and, um... Margaret Thatcher. And Nancy  Pelosi. The Parks Department is the site  of another one of those cracks.  And over the course of my political  career, I intend to go around making  thousands of more cracks in things, if  not outright shattering and destroying  them.  LESLIE    Big turnout tonight! Very exciting.  LESLIE   So fire away! Yes?  MAN  I am here because of a crime that is  happening right now all over this city,  that you people know about and do nothing  to stop.  LESLIE  That's horrible.  MAN  Will you commit right now to helping me  stop this crime?  LESLIE  Absolutely. We want to serve you in any  way we can.  MAN  Do you want me to tell you what the crime  is?  LESLIE  Yes. Please, tell me, so I can help you  stop it. I don't understand why you're  being so mysterious about this.  MAN  It's abortion.  TOM   Abortion's legal, dude.  MAN  You promised to stop it.   I  have it on tape!  LESLIE  Sir, first of all, that was a really mean  trap. But more importantly, the city  government doesn't have the ability to  overturn a Supreme Court decision--  MAN  I think you could, if you weren't so  lazy. Mayor Havlicek could.  LESLIE  Mayor Havlicek was mayor when I was a  kid. He was quite an old-school  character.  LESLIE    He might have been able to overturn a  Supreme Court ruling. He died in a small  plane accident when he was thrown out in  handcuffs at 20,000 feet.  ANN  Um...I have --  OTHER MAN  When they gonna open up Ramsett Park   again? It's been closed for a year.  LESLIE  • Yes, we are trying hard to get that park  reopened. There was a new problem  recently...what was it, Tom?  TOM  Angry dogs.  LESLIE  Dogs. That's right. There was a pack of  scary dogs who were attacking the park  workers, and we said, unh unh. Read our  lips. \"Dogs can't bite people!\"  LESLIE   So we are looking into the problem.  Who's next?  LESLIE   Yes, Barry, go ahead.  BARRY  Well, well, well -- today is a great day!  Because last month they put me in jail.  That's right! And my mother had a  restaurant in this town. A creamery. The  head of the police is a ninth degree   mason.  TOM TALKING HEAD  TOM  There are a few regulars who always show  up to our meetings and ramble on about  stuff. Leslie says we should listen to  them like we'd listen to anyone else. I  prefer: mocking them.  BARRY  One day there was a fire. And that's  what killed my snake. Now I have a few  things to say about Laura Linney.  LESLIE  Okay, Barry, thank you.  TOM  No, no, I want to hear what he has to say  about Laura Linney.   BARRY  Laura Linney is a fifteenth degree mason.  In the fifteenth degree they teach you  how to talk with your mouth closed.  LESLIE  Okay, thank you, Barry. Thank you for  your comments.  TOM  I agree with a lot of what he said.  LESLIE  This is valuable. Citizen comments.  Who's next?  ANN  Hi. So, I'm Ann Logan, and a few of us  are here to talk about the abandoned lot  on Sullivan Street.  LESLIE  Alright. Go on.  ANN  I'm a nurse, and frankly I'm not at all  interested in politics.  ANN   But this thing almost killed my  boyfriend, so...  Anyway, on this lot near my house, a  developer dug out a basement for an  office building, and then they went  bankrupt. And now, there's just...this  giant pit.  ANN    It's been there almost a year.  LESLIE   Twelve months, yes, go on.  ANN   It goes right up to the backyard of the  house I rent.  ANN  And my boyfriend -- who's a musician  actually, who I support, but who was  really starting to make some contacts and  apply himself in the music business --  anyway, he was cutting through the lot at  night, and it was raining, and he just --  whoomp! -- fell right in. Broke both his  legs.  ANDY  It was slippery. Did she tell you it was  slippery? Because it was super slippery.  ANN  There was a little item in the paper.  \"Unemployed man breaks legs in abandoned  pit.\" Which -- why do they have to say  \"unemployed\" man? That is inappropriate  editorializing that doesn't belong in a  news piece, in my opinion.  LESLIE  It's the gotcha media.  ANN  The point is, there's a giant hole in the  ground and people are falling in. I've  been trying for months to get someone to  fix this problem -- I've written letters,  and I've made like a thousand phone calls  to the government, but so far...  She makes a zero with her fingers.  TOM  Who fell in again? Your boyfriend?   • Yeah. ANN  TOM  Is he dead?  ANN  No. But he broke his legs.  TOM  Uh huh. How long you guys been together?  Is it a strong relationship?  TOM   I'm not hitting on you. I'm married.  am only asking for background purposes.  MARGARET  We've been to the Revenue Collection  department, and the Transportation  Department, and the City Manager, and we  keep hitting dead ends.  LESLIE  I'm sorry to hear that, but this doesn't  seem like a government problem--  ANN  Actually it is, because the government  owns the land now. So you're going to  have to figure out a different way to  blow me off.  LESLIE  Well, guess what? I'm not going to blow  you off.  ANN    Really.  LESLIE  Yes. I will help you.  ANN  Is that a promise?  LESLIE  More than a promise. A pinky promise. I  pinky promise all of you, right now, that  I will help. And not only will we fill in  that pit, but we will put a beautiful new  park on that land.  TOM  What the hell are you doing?  LESLIE  I'm getting in the game.  ANN  She claims she's going to help us.  Whatever. Frankly she seems like kind of  a simpleton.   LESLIE  I've been in the parks department for six  years, and until now I've only really  been able to engage in park maintenance.  For example, last year I led the city-  wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand  after those problems with the cats. I  heard some testimony from mothers of  toddlers that would make you cry. But  this pit! The chance to build a new  park, from scratch...  This is my Hoover Dam.   TOM  That sounds great. Problem is, anything  over 25 dollars I have to report. So just  call my wife and give her the suits and  then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll  give them to me.  LESLIE  Hey Tom.  TOM  Alright Mr. Mayor. Nice talking with ya.  Leslie! Hello.  LESLIE  That was the mayor?  TOM  Yeah. We were just rapping about some  things.  LESLIE TALKING HEAD  LESLIE  Tom is so lucky. I need to make the  acquaintance of the mayor.  TOM TALKING HEAD  TOM  I swear to God she is the most gullible  human being I've ever met in my life.  LESLIE  Brainstorm. How do I make this happen?  TOM  Go to the City Council directly, ask them  to just front the money.   LESLIE  Nah, money's tight right now. Parks  aren't a priority. I need more  firepower. I need some bigger guns.  Tom looks at her chest and snickers.  TOM  Yeah. Your guns are pretty small.  LESLIE  Tell me about it.   LESLIE  Tom and I work great together. We're  both outsiders -- me as a woman, him  as... whatever he is. I wanna say...  Libyan? Plus he's the size of a child.  Size twenty-eight waist. Plus he  worships the prophet Mahomet.   TOM  Tom Haverford c'mon, I'm Episcopalian.  Three years now.  LESLIE  Well, obviously, what I really need is to  establish a committee.    Committees are power. They are the  lifeblood of the democratic system.    That was good. Did you get that? For  the book?  TOM  Yup. Got it.  LESLIE    • From time to time, I stumble upon a  saying, or a phrase, that really sums up  my feelings about things. Tom is helping  me collect them, for my memoirs.   TOM TALKING HEAD  TOM  No I'm not.  LESLIE  What if we got Mark on board?  TOM  Mark who?  LESLIE   \"Mark who?!\" Brendanawicz!  TOM  Oh. Sure. Whatever. Call him.  LESLIE  You want something done in this town, you  need Mark Brendanawicz. He's a city  planner and he's \"da bomb.\" Smart,  capable, knows where all the bodies are  buried. Just a great, solid, smart, big,  strapping, solid guy.  TOM  She wants to bone him so bad.  LESLIE  What?    Hey! Mark!  MARK  Hey Leslie.   LESLIE  What's up, Brendanawicz, you crazy ol'  Polack?  LESLIE  Politics is rough-and-tumble. Yes, I'm a  woman, but to fit in I sometimes have to  talk like a man, act like a man. You  have to dish it out and you have to take  it.   MARK  \"Crazy   Oh my God. Mark, I'm so sorry. I'm just  trying to kid around. Oh God. Oh God,  I've already screwed it all up.  MARK  Leslie. I'm kidding.  LESLIE  What? Ha ha ha ha! I know. He he he  he! Oh man. Good times. Politics.  LESLIE   So. Down to brass tacks. Do you know  this pit I'm talking about?  MARK  Yeah. Lot 48. I checked it out like a  month ago. It's pretty gross.  LESLIE  As in a gross injustice!  MARK  Okay, but what I meant was, it's  disgusting.  People have been tossing their garbage  into it. And I'm pretty sure there was a  dead wolf in one corner.  LESLIE  Let me ask you this -- do you think I  could turn it into a park?  MARK  A park. Huh.    Well, when I think about the logistics,  and the various hoops you'd have to jump  through, I'd say: is it likely? No. But  is it possible? No. It's not possible.  You should give up.  LESLIE  What? Why?  MARK  There's a million reasons why. I used to  try to get stuff like this off the ground  when I started, but between the  developers and the citizen groups, the  bureaucrats and the anti-government  nuts...it's impossible.  LESLIE  So there's a chance.  MARK  ...No. There isn't. Aim smaller, is my  advice. Have the wolf removed. You  might be able to pull that off before  Christmas.  LESLIE  Mark, I need your help on this. I need  you to support it.  LESLIE   Can you do me a favor? For old time's  sake?  LESLIE  Mark and I...it's complicated. You work  closely with someone, two strong  personalities, passionate about the same  things, sharing a worldview...things can  happen. We slept together.  LESLIE   A while ago. We didn't really talk about  it much afterwards -- we're both  professionals, and it doesn't affect our  work. I don't know. Some day down the  line, maybe we'll give it a chance to  become something more. Who knows.  MARK TALKING HEAD  • MARK  Leslie? No.    Oh my God -- wait -- yes, we did! Wow, I  totally forgot about that. Yes. She's  right. Like five years ago. After some  kind of...party or something? I was  pretty drunk. Anyway. Yeah. How about  that.  MARK  Why do you care about this pit? What's  your angle here?  LESLIE  No \"angle.\" I've been here six years, I  know more about our city and the  government than anyone else, and I've  never had my own project. It's not fair!  It's like, we're back in school and I've  studied really hard and they're not  letting me take the tests Imagine how  • frustrating that would be.   MARK  God if those tests had been called off, I  would have been pissed. And those lousy  snow days too. I hated those.  LESLIE  I know! Mark, I believe that government  can do good things, but you need power,  and getting this park made would give me  power. The more power I can get, the  more good I can do. If I had absolute  power, I could do absolute good!  MARK  Your enthusiasm is...intense, and off- putting--  LESLIE  Thank you.  MARK  But take it from me -- it's just not  going to happen.  LESLIE  But I promised those people I would make  this happen. I promised them in the  meeting.  MARK  Well, you'll just have to accept that you  will be the first bureaucrat in history  to make a promise and fail to deliver on  it.  LESLIE   Not me!  Why do I always think of the perfect  response like one second too late?  ANN  Can you just straighten up your area a  little honey? They're going to be here  soon.  ANDY  Sure.  ANN    That parks lady is coming over, and we're  going to see the pit. Probably just a  photo op for her, I bet. I still think  there's no way the government--  Shhh.  ANDY  ANN  Excuse me?  ANDY  C'mon, honey, if I wanted to watch the  news I'd be watching the news.  ANN  I'm talking about the pit you fell in.  ANDY  But it's boring. That's why we have TV,  take our minds off boring stuff like  that.  ANN  Yeah, boring stuff. Like fixing  problems. Dealing. Improving things.  ANDY  Yeah. Either one.  ANDY TALKING HEAD  ANDY  Here's the deal.  ANDY   When Ann sees something broken, she feels  obliged to fix it. I don't know why, and  I don't really care.  It's the only reason I've eaten a hot  meal in the last three years.  LESLIE  Hello, Ann.  ANN  Hey. Wow.  LESLIE  This is Tom Haverford, my loyal co-  worker. And this is Aubrey, our college  intern. She's going to document our fact- finding mission.  ANN  Okay -- let me just get my purse...    LESLIE  This must be our hero. \"The man heard   round the world.\" How you doing, son?  ANDY  ...Hey.  LESLIE  On behalf of the government of Pawnee, I  want to say that we're going to do  everything we can to help you. Stay brave.  ANDY  Okay.    Can you hand me that TV Guide?  TOM  So, you're a nurse.  ANN  Yeah.  TOM  Like, general nurse or some special kind?  ANN  General, but I get people ready for  imaging tests a lot, so that's my  specialty.  TOM  Do you have to shave a lot of wieners?  ANN  No.  TOM  Sometimes when I brush my teeth there's  blood.  ANN    Well are you using a soft bristle  toothbrush?  TOM  Extra soft. Do I look like an idiot?  ANN  You should go to a doctor. You might  have cancer of the tooth enamel.  TOM  Oh god.  LESLIE  Let's go! Fact-finding mission!  ANN  Right over there is where he fell in.  LESLIE  My God. How did we let this happen?  Soil. Unstable. Crumbly. This whole  lot could be vulnerable to mudslides.  Aubrey -- get some pictures of this.  AUBREY  Of what?  LESLIE  Everything. This whole thing.  ANN  So, you think we can fill it in, plant  some grass, maybe a bench or a tree?  LESLIE  Possibly. But dream with me for a  second: why shouldn't this neighborhood  have a first class park? With a  playground, for kids. Do you have kids?  TOM  I'd say no.  ANN  ...No.  LESLIE  Okay, but there are a lot of kids in the  neighborhood, right? Kids that would  love a shiny new playground, with swings  and a softball field and a pool, and a  jungle gym and tennis courts? And maybe  over there: an amphitheater, for  Shakespeare-in-the-Park.  ANN   It's not that big a pit.  LESLIE  Well, some of those things. Think about  it! A little playground arises from the  ashes of a deadly pit. We could name it  after your boyfriend. \"The Ann's  Boyfriend Memorial Park.\"  ANN  LESLIE  \"The Playground.\" It'll take a little extra  work, but why not try?  ANN  I think that would be great.  LESLIE  Good. Me too.     I'm going in.  ANN  Why?  LESLIE  • I need to see it for myself. Don't  worry. I've got a hard hat on.  ANN  I see that.  LESLIE  Aubrey -- document this.  The key to any fact-finding mission is  you have to really get into the battle  zone. Like a President surveying a  hurricane-ravaged town. Or when Richard  Nixon went to China, to see...you know,  what the Chinese were up to.  LESLIE   A politician can't be effective if she  doesn't see the problem first-hand. You  have to --  LESLIE     Fuck! Ow! Shit! God Dammit! Fuck it!   ANN  Whoa! Leslie!  LESLIE   Faaaaaaaaa!  ANN  Oh my God. Are you okay?  TOM  Let's ditch her. It'll be hilarious.  TOM  Hey, that's a good one. Email me that  please.  AUBREY  She's dustier in this one.  TOM  I'll take that one too.  ANN  • Does it hurt a lot?  LESLIE  No.  ANN  Right.  LESLIE  How can you tell?  ANN  I'm a nurse.  LESLIE  Thank goodness I was wearing the hard  hat.  ANN  But it fell off.  LESLIE   After my head hit that rod.  ANN  • Well, you should be all set now. Hey,  you shed blood for the cause. Now we're  sisters.   CONTINUED:  LESLIE  I've always wanted a sister.  ANDY  I can't believe you fell in too. That's  hilarious.  ANN  It's not \"hilarious,\" Andy.  ANDY  It's pretty hilarious.  LESLIE  Thanks... Sis.  ANN  No sweat.  LESLIE  Okay. I am going to show my boss, Ron  Swanson, our findings, and demonstrate  how dangerous this pit is. He'll have to  listen to me, with a broken clavicle.  ANN  Nothing is broken.  LESLIE  Trust me, it's broken. Do you have one  of those foam collar neck braces?  ANN   Seriously, you're fine.  ANN   Hey -- this is really cool, that you're  helping me with this.   CONTINUED:  LESLIE  Yes. Well, I'm a public servant. You're the public.  It's my honor and pleasure to serve you.  Ann smiles.  LESLIE   Why don't you come by my office later --  we can talk about the project, maybe grab  some Starbucks, maybe gab a little.  ANN  Sure. Why not.  ANN TALKING HEAD  ANN  I don't know. She's a little doofy, but  she's sweet.   LESLIE  I may have misunderestimated Ann. She's  • very dedicated to the cause, like I am.  At first, I thought she was just  a...well, I hate the word \"bitch,\" it  demeans women. I thought she was a bee- yotch. But now -- I wouldn't say she's my  best friend, but we're very good friends,  and getting better all the time.  And health care is a huge issue. A hot  nurse can be a very powerful political  symbol.   RON  Explain this again.   LESLIE  I want a committee, Ron. I want to explore  • the possibility of putting a park on Lot   RON  Aw, that lot is zoned commercial. When  the economy turns around, I'll have  plenty of developers who would love to  exploit that property. You were supposed  to put this fire out.  LESLIE  Here's the thing, Ron. When you've been  in the pit -- have you been in the pit?  RON  What? No.  LESLIE  Well, I have.  RON  When you fell in?  LESLIE  When I visited the bottom of the pit on a  fact-finding mission. And when you're  down in the pit... well, you really get  perspective about what it all means.   LESLIE   I've been a loyal soldier, Ron, but I  want my shot. Give me lot 48.  Let me form a sub-committee, and explore  the possibility of building a small park.  RON  I'll definitely think about it.  LESLIE  I like the sound of that \"definitely.\".   RON   I don't want this Parks Department to  build a park because I don't believe in  government.  I believe government is a waste of  taxpayer money. My dream is to have the  public park system privatized and run  entirely for profit by corporations.  McDonald's I think would be a good fit.  Imagine a shiny clean McDonald's in every  park. Corporations are so much cooler  than government.  RON   This office is a symbol of how I feel  about government:  This M-16 was given to me as a present by  a prominent local gun dealer. I bought  two and he threw in a third for free.  • People who come in to ask me for things  have to stare right down the barrel.  RON SWANSON   What? The barrel's been concreted. I  would have to pull out this plug for it  to be fully operational.  RON SWANSON   This is a partially defused Claymore  mine. I want to remind people that  asking me for anything is a minefield.   RON SWANSON   That's my crown jewel. It's called a  \"\"Czech Hedgehog,\" and it was used to keep  Allied tanks off the beaches in France.  It cost me eleven thousand dollars to  • ship it here. I had to have the floor  reinforced. I like it.    I think it's beautiful.   ANN  Hey, how's it going? Is Leslie around?  AUBREY  What is this regarding?  ANN  Aubrey, it's me. It's Ann, from the pit.   MARK  Lot 48, right? Sullivan Street?  I'm Mark, I'm a city planner.  ANN  Ann Logan. Hi.  MARK  So I want to tell you I have a lot of  respect for community activists. You  guys get dumped on so much, but you keep  at it, organizing the poor, and giving  people a voice and really keeping us  honest in the government. Really cool  work.  ANN  I agree, but I'm not a community  activist. I'm a nurse.  MARK  I feel exactly the same way about nurses.   ANN  Really? Exactly, the same way? How lucky  for you that you didn't just make a  really embarrassing mistake.  MARK  I know, right? Thank god.   ANN  Who else do you completely respect  and admire in exactly the same way?  Animal trainers? Rental car phone  reservation takers?  MARK  Yup. All of them.  MARK   So why is a nurse \"taking on the  system?\" What's in this for you?  ANN  Oh. Well, between you and me, I own  all the nearby lots. I'm thinking  if I can get the city to commit to  fixing this, I can get it for a low  price, bundle it with my lots, and  put up a new mall.  MARK  Wow.  Okay.  ANN  I'm kidding. There's a hole in the  ground, it's ugly and people are  falling into it. That's all.   MARK  I knew Leslie fell in. Tom emailed  me a picture this morning. But who  else?  ANN  ...My boyfriend.  MARK  He  okay?  ANN  Yeah, he's fine. He's great.  MARK  What's he do for a living?  ANN  Why do you want to know?   MARK   Just making conversation.  ANN  He's a...musician. Potentially. I mean,  yeah -- whatever -- he's a musician.   LESLIE  There she is!  And there he is! There both of them are!  ANN  Hey Leslie!  LESLIE  I take it you've met.  ANN  We have. How are you feeling?  LESLIE  I'm feeling...optimistic. Waiting for  news from \"on high\" about whether we get  our committee.  ANN  Hey -- no matter what happens, I want to  say thanks. I mean it. This is...way  better than I thought it would be. You're  really fighting for me.  LESLIE  Well. That's my job. You want a quick  tour?  ANN  Sure...I have to leave in half an hour    RON  Are we meeting about something?  MARK  I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie and  let her try to build a park.  RON  Why?  MARK  Doesn't matter. People like parks.  RON  It's a development lot. Restaurant,  office building, something.  • MARK  You owe me one. Remember? In fact you  owe me several.  RON  You want to cash in for this?  MARK  Yup.  RON  What's your angle?  MARK  Doesn't matter.  RON  Trading four years worth of favors for a  park that'll never get built. You've  gone soft.  MARK  And tell her in the next 30 minutes.   LESLIE  There are 85,000 people in Pawnee, and  this building contains the entire  government. \"The Power Center.\"  ANN   This hallway is endless.  LESLIE  I know. We call it \"Archway Alley.\" Or  sometimes just: \"The Hall.\"  ANN  Clever.  LESLIE  The building is called Pioneer Hall,  named by the first inhabitants of this  building in 1891.  ANN  Wow.  LESLE   Yes -- our crown jewel. These murals  depict the battle of Conega Creek.  LESLIE  We put the minimum wage poster over the  most horrible parts.  ANN  That's...horrifying.  LESLIE  Yes. Come on -- I'll show you the DMV  offices!  ANN  Awesome.  TOM  Hey! Leslie! We did it!  LESLIE   Yes, Ron Swanson has approved our request  • for a committee!   LESLIE  So exciting. This is my first committee,  that I'll have headed by myself. Or with  someone. First committee, ever, of any  kind, for me. But...wow. I mean, in  terms of my future? This is huge. I'm  barely 34, and I've already landed a  Parks Department exploratory sub- committee!    I'm a rocketship.  LESLIE   To our beautiful new committee, a  committee of dreams! And to America!  TOM  Here let me.   TOM  Leslie gets hammered a couple times a  month. It's the only way I can tolerate  her.  MARK  Hey -- just heard the news.  Congratulations.  LESLIE  Thank you. It's very exciting. Do you  think I should call a press conference  right away? Try to get my picture out  there? Or no -- I should wait. Don't  want to overplay my hand. Okay. Good.  So. Stay! Have a glass of champagne!  MARK  Why not.  MARK   Hey.  What's the story?  TOM  Don't bother. She's ice cold. I already  took a run at her and got nowhere.  MARK  Well, maybe you'll do better tonight,  with your wife.  TOM  Dude, why you gotta be like that?  Leslie sidles up to Mark, fueled by liquid courage.  LESLIE  Well well well. Looks like you and I are  going to be working together.   MARK  Looks like it.  LESLIE  Looks like it indood. Deed. Doo-dee-doo- dee-doo.  ANN  Cheers!  LESLIE  Ann, I promise you -- I am going to work  my butt off to get this project done. No  matter how long it takes. This butt is  coming off!  Ann smiles.  • MARK  That's our Leslie. She's one tough bird.  LESLIE  America is a funny place. It's full of  opportunities, full of hope, full of  small towns and big cities and real  people and delicious beverages and hot  guys. You just'never know, in America,  when opportunity is going to strike.  Are you excited?  ANN  Definitely. I'm fired up.  LESLIE  • Yeah!  ANN  I've always heard that democracy, or  whatever, only works if people get  involved. Well, I'm getting involved!  LESLIE  That's right.  \"Soul sistah, soul sistah, soul sistah!\"  ANN  I'm a nurse, you know? People come into  the E.R. with chopped off fingers and  compound fractures--  LESLIE  Like me, with my clavicle!  ANN  -- sure -- and if I can handle real blood  and guts, I can handle this. I'm making  a vow here. No matter what, I'm going to  get that pit filled in, even if it takes  two months!  What? What's so funny?  LESLIE  Wh0000000000!   LESLIE  At first the committee will just be the  three of us and Mark. We'll have our  meetings on Ann's days off. Now -- what  to call the committee?  TOM  The Sub-Committee for a Better Tomorrow.  LESLIE  Too vague. That could be about anything.  TOM  The Sub-Committee for Improving Our  Nation's...Tomorrows.  • LESLIE  Better...  ANN  Why can't it just be, like, \"The  Committee to Fill In the Pit?\"  LESLIE  The name is crucial. It has to inspire  confidence in taxpayers. \"The Tennessee  Valley Authority.\" Man, don't you just  want to give your money to that? Aren't  you happy that exists?  How about \"The Extraordinary Sub-  Committee on Pit Enhancement?\"  ANN  That sounds like we're making it bigger.  LESLIE  Pit Fixing? Fixation? Pit Betterment.  TOM  Pit Beautification?  LESLIE  • Pit Beautification.  \"Hi, Leslie Knope, Executive Director of  the Departmental Ad-Hoc Sub-Committee for  Pit Beautification.\" Boy, that sounds  good.  \n",
      "Michael: All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library? Jim: Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So... Michael: So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? Jim: Actually, you called me in here, but yeah. Michael: All right. Well, let me show you how it's done. Michael:  Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger.  All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake.  That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so...  So that's the way it's done. Michael: I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam? Pam: Well. I don't know. Michael: If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.  Pam: What? Michael: Any messages? Pam: Uh, yeah. Just a fax. Michael: Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate. Pam: You haven't told me. Michael: It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face. Michael: People say I am the best boss. They go, \"God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious.\" \"And you get the best out of us.\"  I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts. Dwight:  Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum  I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum  Jim: My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this. Michael: Whassup! Jim: Whassup! I still love that after seven years. Michael: Whassup! Dwight: Whassup! Michael: Whass...up! Dwight: Whassup. Michael:  What? Jim: Nothing. Michael: OK. All right. See you later. Jim: All right. Take care. Michael: Back to work. Jan:  Just before lunch. That would be great. Michael: Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould.  Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah. Jan: Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda? Michael: Um... Me no get an agenda. Jan: What? I'm sorry? Michael: I didn't get any agenda. Jan: Well, I faxed one over to you this morning. Michael: Really? I didn't...  Did we get a fax this morning? Pam: Uh, yeah, the one... Michael: Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it? Pam: You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet. Michael: Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes. Jan: Do you want to look at mine? Michael: Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you. Jan: OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch. Michael: OK... Jan: Michael, don't panic. Michael: No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent. Jan: No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided. Michael: All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding! Jan: I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other. Michael: OK. No problem. Jan: This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing. Michael: Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing? Michael: Question. How long do we have to...  Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it? Jan: Go ahead. Michel: Packman. Todd Packer: Hey, you big queen. Michael: Oh, that's not appropriate. Todd Packer: Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today? Michael: Uh, I don't know what you mean. Todd Packer: I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes? Michael: Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person. Jan: So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily. Michael: No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.  Like that. Phyllis: So what does downsizing actually mean? Stanley: Well... Oscar: You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing. Angela: I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me. Kevin: Yeah, it'll be you. Pam: I have an important question for you. Jim: Yes? Pam: Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday? Jim: Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous. Michael: Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer. Michael: Hey. Ryan: Hey. Pam: This is Mr. Scott. Michael: Guilty! Guilty as charged! Ryan: Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today. Michael: Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges. Ryan: Yup. Michael: Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee!  Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go.  I'm h*tler. Adolf h*tler.  Pam: I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good. Pam: Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Jim: Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing? Dwight: What? Jim: What are you doing? Dwight: Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate. Jim: It's not on your desk. Dwight: It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation. Dwight: You can't do that. Jim: Why not? Dwight: Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ. Jim:  We'll see.  This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me. Dwight: Downsizing? Dwight: Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on. Pam: You just still have these messages from yesterday. Michael: Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it.  Pam: What? Michael: Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise. Pam: Don't we all? Michael: I'm sorry? Pam: Nothing. Michael: If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.  Michael: I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect.  Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP. Michael: People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable. Michael: Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight. Dwight: I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first. Michael: Assistant to the Regional Manager. Dwight: OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear? Michael: I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody. Oscar: Can't you just tell us. Dwight: Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em? Michael: You don't know what it is.  Dwight: OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted. Michael: I don't need your permission. Dwight: Go ahead. Michael: Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch. Ryan: I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know. Oscar: Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here? Michael: Not gonna happen. Stanley: It could be out of your hands Michael. Michael: It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that. Stanley: Can you promise that? Dwight: On his mother's grave. Michael: No. Phyllis: What? Michael: Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it. Stanley: It's just that we need to know. Michael: I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then. Pam: I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe. Man: Are you sure about that? Michael: Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings. Dwight: Pam, information is power. Stanley: You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you? Michael: No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin. Jim: If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry. Pam: Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um...  Michael: Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp. Ryan: What's up? Nice to meet you. Michael: Introduce yourself. Be polite. Dwight: Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. Michael: Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything. Dwight: Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for dollar 1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand. Michael: That's his profit. Dwight: New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos. Dwight: Damn it! Jim! Michael: OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here? Dwight: He put my stuff in Jell-O again. Pam:  Dwight: That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim. Dwight: It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules. Michael: What is that? Dwight: That is my stapler. Michael: No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food. Dwight: OK you know what, you can be a witness.  Can you reprimand him? Jim: How do you know it was me? Dwight: It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not? Michael: Discipline. Kinky!  All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop. Dwight: Yeah. Michael: And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O. Jim: OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan. Michael:  Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round. Ryan: You should've put him in custardy. Michael: Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores. Dwight: OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all. Michael: Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do. Jim: Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink? Pam: Yeah. Jim: That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink. Pam: So when are we going out? Jim: Tonight, hopefully. Pam: OK. Yeah. Roy: Hey, man. Jim: What's going on? Roy: Hey, baby. Pam: Hey. Pam: Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring. Pam: Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys? Roy: No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home. Pam: OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes. Jim: You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun. Roy: It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going. Jim: Yeah, yeah. Jim: Um... What's in the bag? Roy: Just tell her I'll talk to her later. Jim: No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do. Jim: Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding?  Michael: So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.  Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff? Ryan: Yeah. Michael: You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK? Ryan: All right. Michael: Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to... Pam: You got a fax. Michael: Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first. Pam: What? Why? Michael: Why? Well, theft and stealing. Pam: Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen? Michael: Post-it Notes. Pam: Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents? Michael: 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam. Pam: Are you serious? Michael: Yeah. I am. Pam: I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me. Michael: But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry. Michael:  You been X'd punk!  Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you. Pam: You're a jerk. Michael: I don't know about that. Michael: What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, \"Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?\" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked. Pam: Hey. Jim: Hey. Jim: How are things? Pam: Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with... Jim: Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache? Pam: It's better, thanks. Jim: Good. Good. Pam: Yeah. Jim: That's great Pam: Is...? Jim: Yeah? Pam: Um... Are you... Jim: Am I walking out? Pam: Yes. Jim: Yes, I... Do you want to... Pam: Yeah. Jim: Great. Let me just... Jim:  Oh, Roy. Pam: Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend. Jim: Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it.  You know what, just come here.\n",
      "J.D  Since I was eleven years old, I've been able to sleep through anything. Storms, earthquakes, my girlfriend yelling at me to \"Open the door or we're through, you name it.  J.D  Last night I didn't sleep.  I guess I get a little goofy when I'm nervous. You see, today isn't just any other day.. It's my first day. I'm the man. J.D  And four years of pre-med, four years of med school, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid loans have finally made me realize one important thing... .. NURSE KEARNEY Good, could you go drop aN.G. tube on the patient in 234 and call the attending if the lavage is positive? J.D. Sure. J.D  I don't know jack. So, this is my story... J.D I'm supposed to be up in intensive care- NURSE KEARNEY Good. We just turfed him there. We transferred him to I.C.U. J.D. Was this before you turfed him? NURSE KEARNEY That's what turfing means. J.D. I know that. I'm just having some fun with you. Woo-hoo...  J.D  Look, I got into medicine because I always wanted to help people, but orientation yesterday didn't really focus on patient care... LAWYER The hospital doesn't want to be sued, you don't want to. be sued - let's be honest, no one likes being sued. Being sued is not a good thing... J.D. Turk, You know how I'm totally down with the rap music... TURK Dude, be whiter. J.D  * Chris Turk is my best friend. We * roomed together in college. * We roomed together in med school. * * J.D  * Hell, we even got accepted by the * same hospital. * J.D. Here's the thing. Tupac, DMX, Dr. Dre- in most of their songs, these artists use an extremely volatile word-- TURK Nigger. Yes, I am aware of that.  J.D. My question is this. If we're both singing aiong, and knowing that otherwise I'd never use the word, am I allowed to say-- TURK No. J.D. But what if- TURK Nooo. J.D. See, that's good to know. LAWYER Finally Doctors, if you make a mistake, call me. Please, don't admit it to the patient, or the patient's family especially if there is a death involved. Of course; if the patient is deceased, you can feel free to tell him or her anything. J.D. So, hey, I found us an apartment - DR. KELSO Listen up gang, I'm Dr. Bob Kelso, and I'm your chief of medicine. We've got some exciting times ahead, gang, so I want you to think of me as your safety net, because I promise you, we are a family likehere. Now, I bought pizza in case you'd to stick around and touch base with your fellow interns. Go get 'em, doctors. J.D. Can I sing black magic woman?  TURK You can hum it.  So the surgical interns are gonna go grab a beer. J.D. The medical interns are having a Pac-Man tournament. Apparently we're all twelve. ELLIOT  I love Pac-Man. J.D. Me too. I love playing it, I love watching it played. I just love it. ELLIOT I'm Elliot. TURK ELLIOT Yeah, don't do that. J.D. I'm J.D., this is Turk. TURK So, Elliot... you medical or surgery? ELLIOT Medical. AS TURK REACTS and WE HEAR A PAC-MAN DIE: ELLIOT So every male in my family is a doctor. My dad, my granddad, my brother. Guess that's why Dad gave me a guy's name, made me play sports, date girls, I'm joking.  J.D. I know, I would've laughed if you had paused. ELLIOT Good. It was funny. So, Turk's cute. J.D  If she likes Turk, so be it. J.D. He's getting married. ELLIOT Anyway, I got better board scores than Gramps, my dad, and my stupid brother...I know what you're thinking. J.D  Your butt looks like two pringles next to each other. J.D: No you don't.  ELLIOT The whole Miss having-to-be-the-best thing, \"Hyper competitive, I mean it used to be a big problem for me, used to... past  tense. J.D. Hey. Are we racing?  ELLIOT Yes.  ELLIOT So, you do a lot of cardio?  JEFFERY Reid and John Dorian?  Great. One, I am your resident, Dr. Jeffery Steadman, not Jeff. Two, here are your Manuals... These can answer any basic questions you have so don't bother me, ever, Kay? Three, don't be a moron and open your manual in up front of a patient, Four... J.D.  You ever notice how quickly some people make an impression? JEFFERY. I'm a tool, I'm a tool. I'm a tool, tool, * tool, tool, unbelievably annoying tool. * J.D. Yeah. JEFFERY Finally, these are your beepers. From now on, these control your life, kay? J.D. Sorry, gotta go. J.D. I was beeped... CARLA Aww, first day Bambi? Carla will take care of you - don't look at me when we're moving someone. CARLA We're waiting for Dr. Cox... J.D. Hi, Dr., I'm-- DR. COX Place an I.V. for me. J.D. We'll talk later. DR. COX Carla, a personal question. Do you spray your perfume on or do you keep a tub full of the crap and slosh around in it? CARLA I smell nice.  J.D  C'mon, you've done this to cadavers before. So this guy's alive, just poke it through his skin, poke it through - Now!  DR. COX Time's up. Do that for him, please. I'm also gonna need to get an ABG. J.D. Why are you telling her? DR. COX Shut up and watch. CARLA Awwww, be nice to Bambi. DR. COX This gomer has got to stop trying to die while I'm eating lunch. J.D..  That's a little insensitive.  J.D  Mistake. DR. COX This man is ninety-two, and has full dementia. He doesn't even know we're here. For Christ sake, he's inches away from Carla's rack and he hasn't even flinched. That's so sweet. J.D. What about his subconscious? DR. COX  Eisenhower was a sissy. By the grace of God, I think we're gonna be okay. From now on, when I'm in the room, you're not allowed to talk. DR. KELSO Now, Mr. Dorian, can you tell me what ailment... J.D  I'm gonna love rounds. The constant questions, it's like being on a gameshow.  J.D. What is uremia? DR. KELSO That's my boy. J.D. Uremia may lead to a symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy that tends to affect the lower limbs more than upper limbs, and is more marked aistally than proximally... DR. KELSO Whoa, sport. Who stuck a quarter in you? Nice, clean job with the foley catheter. I J.D  had a nurse do it. J.D. Thank you, sir. J.D  Unfortunately, I'm still afraid to touch anybody. I'd been thinking a lot about Elliot. She's an anal-retentive, crazy, smartypants, but in kind of a sexy way, you know? DR. KELSO Dr. Reid, you're late. ELLIOT I got puked on, and seeing as it was already the fifth time today, I needed to cry for a few minutes. DR. KELSO Nothing wrong with squirting out a few. You're off the hook if you can tell me what to look out for in a uremic patient.  J.D  Anyway, I decided to go for it. J.D. Infection. ELLIOT Infection? DR. KELSO That's my girl. Moving on... ELLIOT I knew the answer. J.D. I'm sure you did. ELLIOT I was just frazzled-- J.D. How could you net be? ELLIOT You know, with the-- J.D. know. ELLIOT Good. But thanks, if I can ever do anything for you-- J.D. You could let your hair down again. ELLIOT Can I wash the puke out first? J.D. If you want. ELLIOT We'll see. BOY. Daddy, why did you marry Mommy? J.D. Well Tiger, I gave her an answer during rounds and she immediately had sex with me.  ELLIOT  Now go do your homework so I can continue to satisfy your father sexually while never questioning his authority.  DR. COX What the hell are you doing?  DR. COX Did you actually page me to ask how much tylenol to give Mrs. Lenzer? J.D. I was worried that it could exacerbate the patient's DR. COX It's regular strength tylenol! Have her open her mouth, throw a handful at her, and whatever lands in there is the correct dosage. J.D. But--  DR. COX And by no means are you to compromise our no talking agreement. J.D. Dr. Cox, if you could give me any advice-- JDR. COX Try not to kill anyone. J.D. Uh-huh. Dr. Kelso tells us all to stay positive. DR. COX Look, I'm going to be careful because I don't want to overstate this: Dr. Kelso is the most evil human being on the face of the earth and may actually be the devil himself. J.D. Super. It's just that this isn't what I expected.Labs and tests  and charts - it's all scut work. Plus most of my patients are... Older and kind of checked out mentally... DR. COX Pumpkin, that's modern medicine. Bureaucratic nightmares, paperwork out the ass, and advances that keep people who should have died years ago alive, when they lost what made them people. Your  job is to stay sane enough so that when someone comes in that you can actually help,  you're not too braindead to function, what!?! J.D. Do you think we should talk about this in front of-- DR. COX Her? She's dead. Write this down, Newbie. You push around a stiff, nobody asks to you do anything. J.D. Thanks, you've been like a father to me. DR. COX Fine, you want some real advice? They find out that you're making nurses do all your procedures they'll throw you out on your ass so quick it'll make you dizzy. J.D  And there it is. DR. COX Have a terrific day.  OLD WOMAN Stop staring at me. CARLA Okay Bambi, here's Mrs. Lenzer's tox screen, Mr. Hobert's blood work... J.D  I couldn't help wondering if Turk is having the same experience I am. TURK I'm such a stud. J.D  Probably not. TURK This morning, I had my hands inside a guy's chest. All the way inside; I couldn't even see them.. I shouldn't be allowed to do that. J.D. And you weren't scared? TURK What's there to be scared of? You know what the attending said: \"One way or another, everyone stops bleeding\". That's deep man. CARLA No. it's not. TURK It's a little deep. J.D. So, hey, we never finished before. I have to tell you about our apartment-  TODD T-man! TURK J.D., Todd. J.D. Hey, how're you do-- J.D. Can I talk to you?  And like that, I was back in high school. You see, surgical interns, they're all slice 'em and dice 'em. They're the Medical interns jocks. - we're trained to think about the body. Diagnose, test, keep everything on a little notecard. The medical interns, well... TODD You've got a stain. J.D  We're the chess club. J.D. I'm waiting for someone. JANITOR Door's broke. Every fifth time or so it don't open. J.D. Maybe there's a penny stuck in there. JANITOR Why a penny? J.D. I don't know... JANITOR Did you stick a penny in there? J.D. I was just making small talk. JANITOR If I find a penny, I'm taking you down. ELLIOT Oh my God being on call sucks. You're all alone, all night - it's terrifying, you know? J.D. The janitor wants to kill me. ELLIOT Anyway, about eleven hours into being on call last night, my twentieth admission was this young girl who was throwing up blood, and.. I actually wished it was me. J.D. You know, I'll bet he's killed before. ELLIOT Seriously, I'd gladly be that sick to lie in  bed, watch TV, get to eat hospital pudding, right? Right? J.D. Yeah, yeah, yeah, blood for pudding. You. know, we're both off Monday night, so maybe, you know, if you're not. busy, I don't know, maybe we could--. ELLIOT I like Italian food, the movie we're seeing starts  at 9, so we'll eat at 7:30, and please don't wear those shoes.  J.D  Bottom line, Elliot is the girl of my dreams. DR. KELSO ..the necrosis, and infected stool most likely indicate what, Dr. Dorian? ELLIOT I don't know. Sir... J.D. I have no idea. DR. KELSO Well, I'm very disappointed in you, son. Dr. Reid, can you help him out? * ELLIOT I'd say it's superior mesenteric insufficiency. DR. KELSO That's my girl. Patient number two... J.D  The only way to bounce back is to stay positive. J.D. Ms. Pratt,I'm here to remove some of that fluid from your belly, relieve a little of that tightness. MS. PRATT Shut up and do it. J.D. Fantastic.  Ma'am, I'm going to need you to roll over for just a second. TURK  Nice. J.D. You can roll back, ma'am. Now this'll just take a second... J.D  C'mon. Not in front of Turk. Just jam the razor sharp needle into her gut.  J.D. I think this needle is too big. I'm gonna get a nurse. TURK Learn by doing, man. Learn by doing.  J.D  I hated him at that moment. For being able to do that, for being happy...  TURK Maybe it was too big a needle. J.D. You think? How do I seal this up? TURK You want my gum? - MS. PRATT  What's going on down there? TURK This is totally normal, ma'am. Just have to put some pressure on it.  J.D. So, you going to move your stuff in tonight? TURK That's why I came by. I just feel like we've done that already, you know? TURK It might be little... good for us to branch out a What do you think? J.D  Tell him you miss him. Tell him you need him to look into your eyes and say that everything's going to be fine just like he did when Tell him the cop pulled you over. J.D. Yeah, I feel the same way. MR. BURSKI I just have bad gas. What're you testing me for? J.D. We need to know if your gas could be harmful to others. J.D. Look, Mr. Burski, I heard a systolic murmur in your heart, which is most likely nothing, but if you don't let me check it out I'm gonna worry about you all day. MR. BURSKI Seriously? J.D. Yeah, it would drive me crazy. MR. BURSKI Then I'll do it. For you. So what's it like being a young hotshot doctor? J.D. Did you ever go to see a movie that everyone told you was great, then because of all those expectations, you ended up totally disappointed? MR. BURSKI Movies nowadays have too many special effects.  J.D. Yeah, that was pretty much my point. MR. BURSKI Kid,you want to know my philosophy of life?  It might help. J.D. Lay it on me, Mr. Burski. MR. BURSKI The hell with everything. J.D. I like that. J.D  My first code. See, here's how it works. Someone's heart fails , they beep in the first doctor who has to run in and tell everyone in the room what to do, basically decide the patient lives or dies... What, am I crazy? J.D. You chicken. ELLIOT Me? Look at you. J.D  Don't worry about the patient. Turk was already there \"learning by doing\". TODD Fire up the juice, baby. TURK Clear.  J.D  Plus it turns out the guy was just slightly anesthetized attached to a faulty monitor.  J.D. I thought, I don't know, maybe we cared about each other. ELLIOT Oh please, if you didn't want to sleep with me you would've done the same thing. J.D. I didn't want to sleep with you. ELLIOT Uh-huh. And Turk's getting married? J.D. Yes, he is... eventually: I'll tell you one thing. There's nothing in the world that would make me sleep with you now. ELLIOT Do me right here. J.D. Okay. ELLIOT See? J.D. Damn.  DR. COX Right. Hand me a trach kit, please?  ELLIOT Great. J.D. Our date is totally canceled.J.D  I was sitting on the floor for two reasons. One, I tried to lock Elliot in that supply closet and she kicked me. Hard. And two, the on-call room was locked. J.D. C'mon, I've got like ten minutes to sleep.  TURK Tell me if I'm going too fast. CARLA Lose the clothes.  J.D  I heard that Turk was going to move in with Todd. I'm surprised that high-fiving freak isn't in there with him. TODD Look at you, T-man! You're on fire! CARLA Nice. TURK Your turn. CARLA Nah, I've gotta get back. But very nice. TURK I'm off Friday, you feel like making me dinner? CARLA Que me estas Biciendo? TURK Or I could take you out. Your call. CARLA Date a surgeon? With the God complex and the married-to-the-work?  Hey Bambi. TURK You coming in? J.D. Thought I might wait for you not be naked.  J.D. You look adorable. MR. BURSKI Ah, the hell with everything. J.D. Hey, I got your test results. You're gonna be fine. One more night and you're out of here.  MR. BURSKI Thank you. Thank you so much. J.D. No problem. PATIENT  Nurse... Nursey... Cutie pie... ELLIOT I'm a doctor, okay. The white coat, the stethoscope - a doctor, got it? CARLA Relax. ELLIOT I just hate it. I hate the \"darlin's\", I hate the \"sweethearts\"... CARLA You don't need to tell me how hard it is being a woman around here. ELLIOT Well, you're certainly furthering the cause by wearing a thong to work and hooking up in the on-call room.  ELLIOT  Word gets around. CARLA You talk like that, do you even know my name? I'm 34, I spend every second of my life either here, or taking care of my mom, so yeah, maybe I needed a little closeness. I'm sure you never had a quickie at the club, or snuck some skinny, flat-butted, college boy up to your sorority room, and judge me? And my thong - I like to think it makes my ass look good, and some days I need to feel good about something around here, and you judge me? Well, guess what. Word does get around, Ms. \"Out for herself\", so you can dump on everyone here if you want, but you will not hurt me. You will not hurt me... J.D. Look at you making new friends.  J.D, I couldn't get any sleep 'cause Turk practically had sex in the on-call room. DR. COX You are aware that I have no idea who Turk is, but good for him. 'Cause Billy, sex is life-affirming. Now, how bout you give me a urine sample, captain. BILLY But I just did five minutes ago. DR. COX Tell you what. This time put the cup on the ground and just go nuts.  J.D, Seems like a good kid. DR. COX Yeah. Why are you here? J.D  I'm worried about being on-call tonight. DR. COX You're worried about being on call tonight. J.D. No. J.D  I don't think I can handle it. DR. COX You don't think you can handle it, do you? J.D  Stop doing that. DR. COX Look, worst case scenario, you kill someone and it hangs over your head your whole life, but that's absolute worst case. Jeez, Newbie, just use the nurses for all the stuff you're still too chicken to do, which is, if I'm guessing, everything. And there's a really tough admission-- J.D. Call you? DR. COX God, no. I was going to say you can hide in the closet again.  BILLY That was mean. DR. COX Yeah, maybe... You forgive me, pal? BILLY I will if you talk about sex some more. DR. COX Boobies. DR. KELSO Hey champ. First night on call starts soon, huh? Gosh, you must be excited. J.D. You betcha. DR. KELSO Oh, About Mrs. Pratt - I heard that you want to put her on the hospital's transplant list. Just thought I'd recommend sticking with dialysis a while longer. Maybe we'll get lucky. J.D. No problem. DR. KELSO Great. Have a ball, on-call. Little poem for ya. J.D. I'll check on-you every ten minutes, okay, Mrs. Marino? NURSE ROBERTS * I need you in Mr. Burski's room. J.D. Are you flirting with me? NURSE ROBERTS * He crashed while you were admitting in the E.R. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism, no way anyone could've it. Anyway, you have to pronounce J.D. But the tests said he was fine.  -NURSE ROBERTS Could you just pronounce him so I can go home? J.D  I'll never forget that moment. The moonlight on his face. The stillness. The shame that all I could think about * was how hard this was for me. J.D. Time of death 0200. J.D  The hell with everything. PIZZA GUY What happened? J.D. You were delivering a pizza to the emergency room, and apparently our sliding glass door malfunctioned, and you just ran right into the glass. You're going to be fine, but you gave yourself a good concussion, so you might have a little short term memory loss, maybe some nausea. PIZZA GUY What happened? J.D  Oh, make it stop. TURK  Man, I lied before, I'm scared every second. Really? TURK Jeez, J.D., all the blood. Thank God for the surgical mask, man, 'cause without it everyone would know that I look like this whole time. J.D. I think it's okay to be scared. TURK Yeah? I really need you to tell me stuff like that once in a while... J.D  He needs me?  TURK Anyway, I just wanted to check on you. J.D  Just say it. J.D. You know the offer still stands if want to you move in with-- TURK Already took the keys from your bag.  PIZZA GUY What happened? J.D. I'll tell you later. J.D  And like that, I got a second wind.  ELLIOT Are you telling everyone that I screwed you over at rounds? J.D. Not everyone. Only the people that work here. Oh, and my parents.  DR. KELSO Morning. How're you holding up? J.D  Ahh, there he is. My safety net. DR. KELSO I saw that you're still pushing for putting Mrs. Pratt on the transplant list. Bad news though, sport, she doesn't have the insurance to cover it-- J.D. Yeah, but the lady's a second away from total renal failure-- DR. KELSO Uh-huh, Okay. Did you ask the Burski family for permission to do an autopsy? J.D. They're still in there with him... DR. KELSO This is a teaching hospital, son. Gotta ask. J.D  Just tell him how you'll ask every time from now on, but you can't face those people again. He'll understand. J.D, Sir, do you think I could just skip this one? DR. KELSO Sure, sport. J.D  See? Every story needs a good guy. DR. KELSO In fact, why don't you just head home, you look tired. g.D. I am pretty tired. DR. KELSO Mr. Dorian, do you not realize that you're nothing but a couple of large pairs of surgical scrubs to me? For God's sake, the reason I carry this chart around is so I can pretend to remember all your damn names. Now, if the patient has insurance, treat them, if not, show them the door. And if someone dies, you get the autopsy. You get it by rounds tomorrow, or I'll be crossing your name Off my chart, are we clear...? Answer me.  J.D. Crystal clear, sir. DR. KELSO Great, sport.  J.D  I don't get it. If he's a jerk, then who's the good guy? CARLA Car accident, he was stable in the E.R., went into arrest about twenty seconds ago.  DR. COX We need to relieve the pressure in the chest. J.D., do it. J.D  Oh, God, no. DR. COX Look at me. You can do this. J.D  And I believed him... J.D. tray. J.D  Kinda. Oh man, oh man, oh man-- J.D. I can't pop it through the pleura. DR. COX Don't be gentle, c'mon now...  J.D. Connect it, please Carla. CARLA Normal rhythm. J.D. No way. DR. COX See? Piece of cake. Your patient. J.D. You don't have to go if you don't want to... DR. COX Your patient, Doctor. CARLA Go ahead. DR. COX Billy, apparently your parents are upset about some language they think you might have picked up here. BILLY Boobies. DR. COX Let me scare some sense into him. Let's hear it. BILLY Bagima. DR. COX Atta boy. J.D  So I guess that's it for now. Thirty- one hours, twelve minutes and I am-- ELLIOT You finally off? J.D. Almost... I have one more really annoying thing to do. ELLIOT If you're talking about getting the Burski autopsy, I already called the family for you and they said fine, and to thank you, and I'm sorry... They didn't say that last part, I did. J.D  The worst part was knowing right then that I could never forgive her. ELLIOT I'm really sorry.  J.D  I forgive her... You see, I can't survive on my own. JEFFERY I'm a tool-I'm a tool.  J.D  Even now, when I finally get to go home and go to sleep, in the back of my head, I'll know the hospital's still here. Wide awake. Waiting for me to come back tomorrow so it can try to beat me. CARLA Bambi, get out while you still can.  But what the hell. The most important thing is that I got through my days without looking like a complete idiot. ELLIOT Get a gurney! CARLA Damn door... JANITOR If you ask me he had it coming.  J.D  I'm the man.  \n",
      "BIG HEAD Hey, man, some guys from Zynga are  throwing an all-night Perplexus tourney.  Maybe we can find some  Stanford kids to hustle. THOMAS Cant.

BIG HEAD Or download a bootleg. THOMAS None of that CodeAcademy crap for  my web site.   The whole idea of  Pied Piper is based on melody  recognition.  If it doesnt work  perfectly, no one will want in. So,  I am making it perfect.   Hey, Dinesh, can you test this  module for me? DINESH Can I eat your salmon? THOMAS  OK. BIG HEAD Youre letting him test your  module? THOMAS Youve got the Perplexus tourney.   I want you to fuck those guys up. ERLICH And you wonder why there are never  any girls around here.  Hey Thomas, can we talk for a  second? THOMAS OK. ERLICH Thomas, Im gonna have to ask you  to vacate. THOMAS What?  Why? ERLICH Youve been here six months.  I  gave you place a to live and plug  in.  Youve given me nothing.  THOMAS Look, Pied Piper is going to take  off. The website is up and running,  it works great, it just needs-- ERLICH Pied Piper is crap.  When you  pitched it you said, The Google of  Music. I thought it had  Applications. THOMAS It does! Have you been on it since  I revamped it?   Once it takes off Pied Piper will  be able to search the whole world  of recorded music to see if there  is a match.  If youre a song  writer... or a band... or anything,  and you wanted to make sure you  werent infringing on copy righted  material, you could find out in no  time.    ERLICH First of all, nobody cares about  stealing other peoples music.   Jesus, they do it on purpose!  Jay- Z and Puffy made whole careers on  it. THOMAS They didnt steal it, they had to  get permission from the copyright  owners... ERLICH They dont own dick.  Theres no  money in music anymore.  Everyone  involved in music is either  stealing it or sharing it.  Theyre  all assholes. And theyre all suing  each other. To stay here, you have  to deliver.  Or at least show some  promise for fucks sake.  ERLICH  Like NipAlert.  Big Heads app.    It gives you the location of a  woman with erect nipples. Thats  something people want. Hows that  coming along?  BIG HEAD Almost ready to enter Beta Phase.  THOMAS Look, I want to change the world.   Make it a better place...   ERLICH We all want to change the world and  make it better.  Like I did when I  developed Accutran.  A lot of  companies use a lot of different  software to aggregate social media  feedback -- Frontier Airlines just  happened to like mine.   THOMAS You cant just kick me out.  When I  signed up I was promised a months  notice if I had to leave.  Its in  writing.  ERLICH Then I am giving you notice.  I  hope youre happy.  You know, when  I sold Accutran there were a lot of  things I could do with my money.   But I wanted to give back.  I  started this place to do something  big.  Really make a difference.   Like Steve.   THOMAS Jobs or Wozniak? ERLICH Jobs.  Now, suppose Steve came back  to us all reincarnated, because he  was a Buddhist you know, and he  showed up here at The Hacker Hostel  looking for a place to help him get  on his feet so he could launch the  next big tech revolution.  What  could I do? Theres no room for  STEVE. Can you believe this?  I  have to tell Steve to fuck off  because there would be no room at  the Inn because you and Pied Piper  are here gumming up the works.  See  what Im saying Thomas? THOMAS That Steve Jobs is Jesus? ERLICH He was Buddist! THOMAS He was a poser!  He didnt even  write code.  GAVIN BELSON  Boodle brings the world to  everyone.  Boodle is everything.   And thats what allows Boodle to  make happy. THOMAS These rents are insane.  dollar 2800 a  month, dollar 4500 a month -- with five  people!   BIG HEAD You forget how goddamn expensive it  is here.    THOMAS I dont want to have to go back to  St. Louis.  I can barely talk to  people in St. Louis.  My parents  still live in St. Louis!  BIG HEAD You think Oklahoma Citys any  better?    And Im going to be the next one  booted.  Ever since GoolyBib landed  two million in seed money Erlichs  been on the warpath about  monetizing. THOMAS GoolyBib?  That Indian guy from  Dropbox you were hanging out with? BIG HEAD No, its a startup -- GoolyBib.  I  think its a real estate app... or maybe its that traffic one. THOMAS Fuck.  Every day somebody in the  valley is hitting it big. But not  me. If I cant pull it off now,  when there are billions of dollars  just LOOKING FOR A START UP, it  might not ever happen. BIG HEAD Yeah, no kidding. THOMAS What are you worried about?  Erlich  loves Nip Alert. BIG HEAD Hes just blinded by boobs.  Once  he scratches the surface hes going  to see theres giant holes in this  thing.  Its based on self  reporting. I cant put sensors on  women to report when their nipples  are erect.  I get one clown to send  out fake reports and the whole  thing collapses.  I need something  to make it objective.  THOMAS Maybe I could develop an image  recognition program, kind of like  the melody recognition in Pied  Piper.   Big Head is coming around. BIG HEAD Or infra red cameras that detect   changes in body heat.  THOMAS Fuck, Im going to have to go to  graduate school.  I cant afford to   stay here even if Im working full  time at Boodle.   GAVIN BELSON  That is how Boodle can change the  world. THOMAS Changing the world, one crappy app at a time.  BIG HEAD Hey, did you hear what Peter  Gregory is doing? THOMAS You mean buying that island in the  Pacific? BIG HEAD Hes building one actually. Its  gonna be this giant platform in the  middle of the ocean. And I think  hes designing a new monetary  system for it.  But anyway, hes  also offering a hundred K to people  willing to skip or drop of college  to pursue any idea they have.  I  mean, it has to be really kick ass.  THOMAS Pied Piper kicks ass.   BIG HEAD Hes speaking in Palo Alto tonight.   We should go. See if theyll let us  talk to him.  I dont know what happened to that  guy, but he really hates college. Thomas considers this idea.  Big Head eats another energy  bar.  Hes wired, tapping his hands, moving his legs. BIG HEAD  Fuck, I dont know if its the  energy bar or drink or gum but I  cant wait for tonight.  And I  cant sit still.  THOMAS Brogrammers. BROGRAMMER #1 A double machiatto for me.  BROGRAMMER #2 Make mine a double double. BROGRAMMER #1 Yeah!   BROGRAMMER #2 Hey, To-mas -- you been working  out?  BROGRAMMER #1 So how is every little thing? THOMAS Eh... not so good.  Gotta find a  place to live, so if you guys know  of anything... BROGRAMMER #2 Youre leaving the Hacker Hostel? THOMAS Getting kicked out. Ive got a  website that I think could be huge,  but nobody gets it.    BROGRAMMER #1 We might get it.  Wed love to take  a look.  Whats it called? THOMAS Pied Piper.  BROGRAMMER #1 Sounds amazing.  Why dont you  shoot it over to me and well give  it a look.  Maybe we can help.  PETER GREGORY Gates, Ellison, Jobs, Dell. All  dropped out of college.  Silicon  Valley is the cradle of innovation  because of DROP OUTS. We need  innovation and we need innovators!   Colleges are choking and strangling  with conformity what the drop outs  created through inspiration!   PETER GREGORY  College has become a cruel,  expensive joke on the poor and the  middle class that only benefits the  perpetrators of it -- the bloated  administrations and the myopic  teaching staffs.  Wages for  graduates are going down.  Employment opportunities for  graduates are shrinking, but the  cost of a higher education just  keeps going up and up and up.     BEARDED ACADEMIC You are a dangerous man, spewing  ignorance!   PETER GREGORY I dont think so. Im just saying  that people should trust themselves  more than a system that happily  churns out unemployed debtors and  provides dubious value. BEARDED ACADEMIC The true value of a college  education is intangible. PETER GREGORY The true value of snake-oil is  intangible as well.  PETER GREGORY  If you have a truly unique and  brilliant idea I can promise you  that any university worth its  weight will crush it with their  lack of creative thought and your  now monumental pile of debt.  BEARDED ACADEMIC Fascist. . THOMAS Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory?  I have  an idea Id love to pitch-- Monica cuts him off. MONICA There were sign up sheets to have a  personal consultation with Mr.  Gregory. THOMAS There werent any slots left. MONICA Im sorry.  THOMAS I just thought I should talk to him  before I give up and... go back to  college. PETER GREGORY Dont!  Wait, where? THOMAS I dont know, probably Boston  University.    PETER GREGORY Thats over fifty thousand a year.   Do not do that.  Go work at Burger  King.  Go into the woods and forage  for nuts and berries.  But do not  go back to college!  I think I have been played.  Fine.   Go ahead and pitch. You have until  I fasten the seatbelt in my car.  THOMAS Pied Piper is a proprietary site  that allows you to find if your  music is infringing on existing  copyrights.  Imagine if you were a  song writer....   PETER GREGORY I dont think I could write a song. THOMAS But if you did... PETER GREGORY I dont even know if I can say  Pied Piper is a proprietary site.   Well I guess I just did but it  wasnt easy.  MONICA Crunching all those songs to find  matches sounds like a lot of data  flow.  PETER GREGORY Yes.  Yes it does.  MONICA Look, why dont you send me the  link for your project and well  take a look. THOMAS Great, if you give me your email address Ill send you the link. MONICA Why dont you just write it down  for me.  BIG HEAD Sorry.. Im just thinking about...  image recognition.  ERLICH ...the airlines had a problem, and  I had Accutran.  So... wow me.    PITCHER Ok, here it is:  Bit Soup.  Its  like alphaBET soup but its all  ones and zeroes.  See its binary.  Because binary is  just ones and zeroes  ERLICH I KNOW WHAT BINARY IS!!! Jesus!   Ive memorized the hexadecimal  times tables! Ask me what 9 times F  is!! I dont need you to tell me  whats binary and I dont NEED you  thinking about soup.  I NEED you  thinking about code.  This is  Silicon Valley, not... ...Paris, Texas.  Thats where Campbells Soup is.  ERLICH  Look, I got one slot opening up  very soon, whos gonna get it? ROLAND So that thing is from the 1400s? BIG HEAD Not this one literally, but the  sacbut is the least evolutionized of all brass instruments, so it  would be the same as one from the  14th century. DINESH So do you guys play anywhere?  Like  clubs or anything?  BIG HEAD Not yet.  Were trying to play  Street Fair this year.   Problem is, theyre more into  traditional Sacbut, which we can  do, but it seems like it would be  selling out or something -- just  doing what people expect. ROLAND I dont think anyone ever expects a  sacbut ensemble anywhere... THOMAS Everyone likes music.  I cant  figure out what it is about Pied  Piper that people dont get? DINESH Applicability? THOMAS I dont know... Peter Gregorys  head of operations said to send her  the link but she was probably just  shining me on. DINESH/ROLAND She? BIG HEAD Man, she was hot. ROLAND Why didnt I see her on nip alert? BIG HEAD Because I was too distracted.  See,  thats another bug I have to work  out. LANGDON This is probably the worst time  ever to be a laid-off publicist.  TANDY Yep.  Social media. LANGDON I know!  There are no cool jobs  anymore because everyone is out  there blogging and doing it for  free!  At least youre working non- profit. TANDY Im working the phones for  mesothelioma for ten bones an hour  and there are no parties.  No  galas. No deep pockets. No  connections.   LANGDON Remember those Pediatric AIDS fund- raisers?  Those were huge. TANDY Yeah, thats how I met Jerry  Weintraub.  He took me to Cannes.   God, I miss the Hotel Du Cap.  LANGDON Theres just no money in non- profits anymore.  Then I guess  theres no money anywhere anymore.   And I need a job.  Im in way default on my student  loans.  Why the hell did they lend  me money to major in Art History.  Assholes!!  TANDY Its fucked up.  Wanna go to Vespio tonight? LANGDON I dont know, we keep running into  the same guys.  All the guys with  money in LA seem to be old and fat. TANDY Except for the professional  athletes. LANGDON Yeah, theyre hot but theyre all  rapists. TANDY Yeah, or Christians. LANGDON I would even settle for a guy who  wasnt rich as long as he wasnt a  douche. TANDY Keep telling yourself that.  I  think you would be bored to death.  My mom always says its just as  easy to fall in love with a rich  guy as a poor guy.   LANGDON Not around here... TANDY I really should have married Tom  when I had the chance.  Id be  living in a house in Malibu.  I  wouldnt be worried about getting  older.  Ive seen lines on my face.  Well, just around the eyes, but  they are there.   LANGDON Eyes arent as hard to fix as necks  and hands but... Yeah, Im not even  getting carded anymore.   LANGDON  Why cant we meet guys like that? TANDY Geeks? LANGDON Yeah.  Theyre rich and smart and  theyre our age. TANDY  Yeah, and they dont look rapey.  But theyre all up North.    LANGDON So a half hour plane ride away  theres all these gazillionaires?   What the hell are we doing here? TANDY Getting older.  And poorer.    BROGRAMMER #1 Lets look at this stupid thing. BROGRAMMER #2  You have to download your own  player?  Hey look at me, I traveled  back to 2009! BROGRAMMER #1 Wait a second.  Look at this file  size.  1.2 Megabytes?  No way!  I  know that song.  Thats at least 3  on itunes...  BROGRAMMER #2 Wow, that doesnt sound at all  downgraded.  BROGRAMMER #1 I really cant hear the difference.     BROGRAMMER #2 And the file size is like, half.   How the hell did he do that? BROGRAMMER #1 I have no idea.  Some kind of new  lossy compression I guess.  JARED What are you guys listening to? BROGRAMMER #1 Were listening to 1.5 gigabytes of  sound that should take up 4.5  gigabytes.  JARED Do you realize how huge this could  be?  With all the data storage and  data flow problems.  The  applications could be endless.  GAVIN BELSON I want it. ERLICH Hey, Im being a good guy here.   You can either get me a zip drive  with any and all code you worked on  or thought of working on while you  lived here, or you can just clean  the bathroom.  Up to you.  THOMAS A Boodle number again.  Its  probably those fucking brogrammers. They keep calling to tell me how  bad my website is.  I really dont  want to answer just to hear about  what an asshole I am. ERLICH Youre on. EAGER GUY My site is called Mashville. ANGLE ON THOMAS  THOMAS  I just want to put an end to this.  Hi, Thomas Peckering, Im an  asshole, tell me how much you hate  Pied Piper.  THOMAS  What?  Really?  Wait, is this a  prank?  Can you prove its real?   OK, Ill call right back.  THOMAS  Holy shit.  OK... Ill be there.  THOMAS  I have a meeting with Gavin  Belson... he likes Pied Piper. ERLICH I own ten percent of Pied Piper. THOMAS You said it was a shitty idea. ERLICH It was a shitty idea.  Im not sure  what it is now.  Whens your  meeting? THOMAS Right now. ERLICH Ill go change.   THOMAS What the fuck am I waiting for?  JARED Good to see you, Thomas.  Now Gavin  is running about thirty minutes  late. THOMAS Well, its been forty minutes  already so does that mean another  30 minutes from now then...?  OTHER EXECUTIVE You should know Gavin is very  excited about your site.  Have you  met Gavin? THOMAS Ive never even seen him in person.  OTHER EXECUTIVE Its amazing.  Youll just feel so  energized after you meet him.  Im  a VP here and I only see Gavin  about ten minutes a month.  ANOTHER EXECUTIVE But that ten minutes is just  incredible.  Indescribable.   Prepare to have your life changed.  SENIOR VP I heard Thomas Peckering was here.   Has he ever met Gavin?  No?   OTHER EXECUTIVE I told him its amazing. SENIOR VP That hardly begins to describe it. DESIGNER We really need to do something to  fill that huge space up there.  Now  I know you wont like this idea,  Gavin, but how about a nice, bold  picture of you to fill it?  GAVIN BELSON OK.  But I dont want to just pose  this time.  Maybe we can get a shot  of me... innovating. DESIGNER Perfect. SENIOR VP  Ah, Gavin...  THOMAS Hello?  THOMAS  Its Peter Gregory. GAVIN BELSON Its weird.  They always travel in  groups of five.  Tall skinny white  guy, short skinny Asian guy, fat  guy with a ponytail, some guy with  crazy facial hair and then an east  Indian guy.  Do they trade guys  till they all have the right group? POWERADE REP Ummm... Im not sure, but we are  very excited about becoming the  official energy product of Boodle  Corporation.  You know our products  are not just junk loaded with sugar  and caffeine.  I mean of course  they have those but they really are  an excellent nutritional product. GAVIN BELSON When I first started Boodle I  worked those guys 24/7.  Its  amazing what you can get human  beings to do for dollar 45 worth of ice  cream.  But the thing is, now  everyone wants to be healthy... Get the fuck out. THOMAS Im actually outside Gavin Belsons  office right now, Mr. Gregory.   Here he is!  Can you hold on a  second?  GAVIN BELSON So, Thomas Peckering is here!   Gavin is looking at an overweight guy with a pony tail until  Jared guides him over to Thomas.  Gavin acts like he has just  found a long lost friend.   There you are, Tom!! Im sorry  these gentlemen kept you waiting. He gives Jared and the other executives dirty looks.  They do  their best to look apologetic.   Heres the thing -- I love what you  did.  THOMAS You REALLY like Pied Piper? GAVIN BELSON LOVE IT!  Fill him in Jared!  JARED Now, Thomas, of course since you  developed this fantastic project on  the Boodle campus while employed by  Boodle, technically it is the  property of Boodle, but Gavin is  prepared to give you quite a nice  raise - and a promotion of course. THOMAS Oh, well actually Ive only worked  here at Boodle a few weeks.  I  needed a job because things werent  panning out and... well I created  this site months before I got here. ERLICH  Thats right!  He created it while  living AT MY INCUBATOR.  BIG HEAD Sorry, he threatened to kick me out  of the house if I didnt get him  in. ERLICH Scott Erlich.  GAVIN BELSON Ill give you dollar 600,000 for it.    GAVIN BELSON  But I am not just giving you  dollar 600,000, I am giving you the full  weight of Boodle.  We have the  reach and the muscle and the  resources to take what you have  done and push it to the global  level. At Boodle we dont ask  people what they want.  We tell  them what they want. And they thank  us for doing it. Boodle can bring  you the world.  BIG HEAD Hello?  Really?  Wow.  Sure. He hands his phone to Thomas. BIG HEAD  Its Peter Gregory.  I dont know  how he got my number.  THOMAS Hello, Mr. Gregory, Im so sorry.   Oh, you heard that?   Uh huh... Uh huh... GAVIN BELSON  Ill give you ten million dollars  for it!  THOMAS Gavin Belson just offered me 10  million dollars for Pied Piper.  PETER GREGORY Ten million?  Im prepared to give  you one hundred thousand dollars.   THOMAS Peter Gregory offered me one  hundred... ...thousand?  PETER GREGORY File size is a problem that is  never going away.  That makes your   compression code very valuable.   Ask yourself this, Thomas:  Did you  come out to Silicon Valley to make  ten million dollars and disappear?   Or did you come to make billions  and leave your mark? You could be  up there with the greats.  THOMAS Mr. Belson, I have a great idea!   Peter Gregory is only interested in  the compression algorithm I  created, so I could do Pied Piper  with you and develop the  compression technology with him. GAVIN BELSON The compression is the only thing  about the fucking stupid site I DO  WANT!! GAVIN BELSON  Dont be an idiot.  Im offering  you real money.  Ten million, right  now.   THOMAS Excuse me... I...I need to use the  bathroom...  THOMAS So what would my position with the  company be? JARED Your position? THOMAS What would I be doing? SENIOR VP You could just think of something  else genius. THOMAS And you guys would own it? SENIOR VP Well, yes, as per the terms of the  contract. But-- THOMAS Yeah, I meant to ask you about  that, this contract is for thirty  years. SENIOR VP Yes, the ten million is paid over  thirty years. THOMAS This looks like a restraining  order. JARED Yes, well, Gavin is a very busy  man... and he doesnt want to get  in your way... or you in his.  It's not necessarily a bad thing. MONICA Whoa, someones on edge.  THOMAS Yeah, maybe.  Wonder why. MONICA Well, I came by to let you know  that whoever you go with,  everything will be just fine.  Boodle is creepy and Peter is...  well nuts, but you have two of the  biggest players in Silicon Valley  fighting over you.  Enjoy it. THOMAS Yeah, I dont see that happening. I  have to make the most important  decision of my life! And Im not  good at making those kinds of  decisions. MONICA So, what kind of decisions are you  good at making?  THOMAS Technical ones.  Fixes.  Cracking  code and making it work.  And then  making it work better.  I like  having discreet reducible problems  and solving them.  Im not much of  a big picture guy. MONICA Maybe you are and maybe you arent.   Maybe you just need bigger problems  to solve.  THOMAS So, Peter Gregory sent you here to  offer me bigger problems? MONICA Nobody sent me over here.  MONICA  When you dont try to see the big  picture you miss a lot.  Even  things that are right in front of  you.  THOMAS  Ive been thinking about this a  lot, and I think Boodle is a great  opportunity, but Im a little fuzzy  about just what exactly I would do.  GAVIN BELSON You can do anything, learn to play  zithers, play D&D all day long.   Hell, grow a pony tail, grow  pigtails, I dont care.  JARED What Gavin is saying is that youll  have complete freedom.  THOMAS Well, its just that I kind of want  to be a part of something.  I want  to help take this to the next  level.  So I was thinking maybe if  we became partners...  GAVIN BELSON I'm willing to give this dickhead thirty million dollars if I never  have to talk to him again! JARED Gavin, were still on speakerphone.  GAVIN BELSON I know!  LANGDON It looks like a Four Seasons but  sure as hell doesnt feel like one. TANDY OK, I have never felt less sexual  energy in my life. GUY Hey girls.  My names James.  I started Zcranium.com. We just got  two million in start up money. TANDY Oh really?  So youre like, a  programmer or...? GUY Fuck yeah!   I was writing code when I was 8. I  was a math wizz Sergie Brin?!   Larry PAGE?!! Fucking Larry  Elllison??!!! Theyre NOTHING! Im a tenth level magic user!!! TANDY This is it?  This is where all the  tech billionaires decided to live? LANGDON It cant be. Excuse me, is this Palo Alto? LANGDON It looks like its all guys.   Thats gotta be good, right? JIN YIANG This bullshit.  Why I gotta buy  beers?  That motherfucker just get  30 million dollars from Boodle. ROLAND Cause you never pay for shit, Jin Yiang.  And this is a big night for  Thomas. JIAN YANG Why you talk fucked up like that?  ROLAND  Just cmon. LANGDON  Thomas.  TANDY We can still catch the late flight  back to LA.  LANGDON Were not going anywhere. ERLICH You don't want to work for assholes and now you don't have to.   You're  like me - you want to build  something.  JARED He turned down 30 million dollars?  GAVIN BELSON Well, look at it this way -- I have  30 million dollars that Im going  to use to destroy that sad,  pathetic, stupid prick. THOMAS With this new company were really  going to try and do things right.   First order of business -- changing  the name.    Yes, I know Pied Piper sucks. THOMAS  Oh... Hey.  I turned down you guys.   And my decision is final. JARED I know.  And I respect that.  As a  matter of fact, thats all I can  think about... that you turned down  30 million dollars because you  cared about something.  You were  passionate about something.  I want  to feel that way.  I want to work  for you.  I dont know if Gavin  will give me a good recommendation  but Im really fucking good at  business development. THOMAS It always sounded like bullshit when every guy with a start up said  that they wanted to change the  world  Okay, it still sounds like  bullshit... but maybe we can make  our mark.  ERLICH AND MAKE SOME MONEY!!! THOMAS Were going to need some energy  drinks. BIG HEAD Big ones.  \n",

Or solitude? Or even love?  Amy: That's actually a cubic zirconia knockoff. It's called PlastiClear. Bo: What happened to the dollar 8 ones? Amy: We're all sold out of those, sorry. But this one's only dollar 2 more. Bo: I get it. You advertise the cheap jewelry to get the suckers in the door, then you push the expensive stuff. Amy: Well, I wouldn't use the word \"suckers\" or \"expensive\" or \"jewelry\". Bo: Fine. I got to stand in line for cigarettes anyhow. Amy: Great. I hope you and your fiance are very happy together. And that you don't procreate. Glenn? Glenn: Huh? Amy: I'm taking a mental-health break.  Glenn: Okay. Have fun now. Reflect.  Dina: Just checking over your new hire forms. American citizen. Nice. No dependents. Me neither, unless you count my birds. It just doesn't say anywhere on here if you've got a girlfriend. Jonah: I didn't, is there a space for that? Dina: There's this section here, \"Is there anything else we should know?\" Some people like to volunteer it. Jonah: Oh. Umm, then also no. Dina: No. Jonah: No. Dina: Okay, well, I will just jot that down, then. But you are heterosexual, right? Jonah: Are you allowed to ask that? Dina: No. Amy: Smart. We always keep the best rolls right in the middle. Oh, wait. Jonah: No, no, no. Let me help you with that. Amy: Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine. Jonah: It's fine, I work here. It's, like, my it's my job to help customers, so. Amy: You work here? Since when? Jonah: Since right now. I'm, it's actually my first day. Amy: Oh. Jonah: I know. I don't seem like the kind of person who would work in a place like this. Amy: Yeah, that's why I was so surprised. I was like, \"What?\" \"What?\" \"Him?\" \"What's he doing cleaning up toilet paper?\" I think it's because you just you have this very intelligent, educated, more cultured quality, I mean, compared to yeah. Jonah: Oh, hey. Look, I get that you're complimenting me, but it might sound a little condescending, so, you know. Amy: Oh, yeah, thanks. No, I wouldn't want to sound condescending in front of somebody who works here. Jonah: Right. Cheyenne: Hey, can I run out for two minutes? This thing is kicking my bladder like it owes him money. Jonah: Oh, you know what, I'm actually not in charge. Amy: Yes, of course. I'll take Carly off express. And Vivian can bag, so take as long as you need. Cheyenne: Ah, thanks. Amy: Little tip. Don't let the other workers here know how much better than them you are. They hate that. I don't know why, maybe because it sounds condescending. Welcome.  Dina: All right, campers, listen up. I've got an important announcement. This is your garden variety generic decongestant. And this is crystal meth, okay? The tweakers use this to make this. So stop selling them this, so they can't make this. Cheyenne: That guy told me he had a really bad cold. Dina: He was buying 35 boxes, Cheyenne. That should have been a red flag, okay? Use your noggin. Glenn: Let's thank Dina for that helpful tip of the day. Thank you, Dina. Garrett: Am I the only one that thinks it's weird that she walking around with a bag of crystal meth? Jonah: Hey, listen. I think there might have been a misunderstanding. I'm not an elitist, so... Amy: Oh, elitist? What is that? Jonah: Like, a person who thinks they're better than ... you know what elitist means. Amy: Oh, yeah. They learnt that to us in public school. Glenn: Anyway, I am so proud to welcome two new angels to our Cloud 9 family. Why don't you introduce yourselves? Okay. Jonah: Hello, everyone. I am Jonah. And I am I am excited to be here. This is gonna be fun, so. Mateo: My name is Mateo Fernando Aquino Liwanag, and I'm here to make something of myself. Spread my wings Whoo! See how far I can fly. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Jonah: Yeah, I, too, would like to see how far I can fly. So. Garrett: Saved it. Jonah: Thank you. Glenn: Now, I used to end these meetings with some wisdom from the Good Book. But then someone reported me to corporate. Dina: Heck yeah, I did. Look, I'm a Christian too, but in these four walls, my bible is the employee code of conduct. Glenn: We all thank you for it. Dina: Yeah, you're welcome. Glenn: I pray for you, Dina. Dina: I pray for you, too, Glenn. Glenn: No, I'm praying right now. Amy: I'm praying so hard. Glenn: I'm praying harder than you. I know how. So to welcome our new employees. Welcome. Welcome to Cloud 9. Garrett: This is my jam.  Jonah: Hey, do we have any kind of training? I've just been wandering from one department to another, trying to look like I have purpose. Garrett: It works better if you carry a box. There you go. See? You'll learn as you go. Look, man, only a couple things to remember: always show up on time, don't steal, and stay on the floor supervisor's good side. Jonah: The floor, who's the floor supervisor? Garrett: I got to go get another box. Jonah: Hey, can we can we start over? I'm Jonah, as you know. And you're Ramona. Amy: Nope, that is not my name. I just don't like random strangers using my name like we're buddies. Jonah: Right, like how hookers don't like to be kissed on the lips. Amy: Did you just compare me to a hooker? Jonah: No. Amy: You look bored. Let me help you with that. All electronics are supposed to be 25% off, but our POS system is down. So you scan, hit \"reassign,\" \"enter,\" \"override, yes,\" \"reduce 0.25,\" \"enter, yes, yes.\" You are not paying attention. Jonah: I'm sorry. Go ahead. Amy: \"Confirm,\" \"enter, yes.\" Got it? Jonah: If I guessed your name, would you tell me if I was right? Amy: Take this. Cheyenne: Oh, it's so pretty! Jonah: I'll make a list. Uptight Lady: Oh, excuse me, miss. Do you know the difference between a stool softener and a laxative? Amy: I'll be right with you, ma'am. Cheyenne, what's going on? Cheyenne: My boyfriend just asked me to marry him. UptightLady: I don't want it soft. I want it out of me. Amy: You know, I hadn't realized earlier that Cheyenne was the lucky girl you'd be proposing to. Bo: Yeah, well, I knocked her up, so my dad says I have to. Cheyenne: So romantic. Bo: That's how I do it, yo. 100% love. UptightLady: Bulking agent? Why would I want more bulk? Ugh. Amy: Chey, you didn't say yes, did you? Cheyenne: Why wouldn't I say yes? Amy: Um Cheyenne, look at me. I know how easy it is to get swept up in the romance of all of this. But think it through, okay? Don't do something you're gonna regret for the rest of your life. UptightLady: Yeah, okay. I'm gonna go sleep on it.  Jonah: Hey. I think I got it down. Mateo: No offense, but you're my competition, so I'm kind of actually rooting for you to fail. Okay, thanks. Bye. Jonah: Hey! I figured it out. Amy: We need new shelf flags for the end caps, but we should check the DCPs first, because last time. What is happening? Glenn: Could it be a race riot? It's so hard to tell in the early stages. Could be the rapture, but then why am I still here? Jonah: Hey. I am killing it over here. Amy: You're only discounting everything 25%, right? Jonah: Yeah, \"scan, \"reassign,\" \"yes,\" \"override,\" \"yes,\" \"reprice\". Amy: Reduce. Jonah: Huh? Amy: Reduce 0.25. Reprice 0.25? That would change everything to 25¢. Shut it down! Shut it all down! Cheyenne: If you sign up for our Heavenly Shoppers program today, you'll save 15% off your purchase, which would drop your price to 22¢. Amy: Stop selling everything! Shut it down! Shut it all down! Sir, you need to stay right there. Frank, nobody leaves! Ma'am! Ma'am, I'm sorry. I'm gonna need to recheck some of these items. SoccerMom: No thank you, buh-bye. Amy: I'm sorry, I can't just let you leave with a whole basket full of 25¢ tech, oww! SoccerMom: I have more where that came from, lady! Amy: Oh, I don't think so! Garrett: Attention, shoppers. Due to an employee error, very expensive electronics are pricing out at 25¢. This mistake is being corrected, so stock up quick! Go, go, go, go! Jonah: What I'm trying to say is, this is not 25¢. Sir, no. No two-five, no. SoccerMom: It touched my car; it's mine! Amy: That's not a thing. SoccerMom: It is a thing. Mateo: I don't want to be \"that guy,\" but if you had to compare my performance versus Jonah, uhh, okay. Garrett: Yeah, you better hurry up, girl. You better get that TV. Frank : Stop, stop! Please, I'm begging you! Jonah: She's very, she's, they're very pretty, yep. Amy: Ow! Frank! Frank: Y'all don't want to do this. Please! Dina: Sale's over!  Glenn: There's no need to identify whoever it is whose fault this was. We can all learn a lesson here. Mateo: Would that lesson be not letting Jonah reprice inventory in the future? Glenn: It might be, yes. All right. Punctuality. I do not tolerate it, because I do not tolerate it in myself. I am an angry man, so I get places early... Jonah: Hey do they allow employees to date supervisors? Garrett: I don't know. Why? Jonah: Just curious. Glenn: Let's always remember, the customer is always right.  Jonah: Hey, what's-your-name, check it out. Amy: Ah. I was wondering what was taking so long to stack a few cans. Jonah: I just I wanted to reiterate how sorry I am about before. Amy: And when a customer wants a can of ginger root beer and the whole thing collapses on top of them, how are you gonna feel then? Jonah: I was just trying to have some fun. Amy: This might be a cultural thing, but around here, the less screwing everything up you do, the better. Jonah: You talking about the cans or the pricing thing? Amy: You see, the fact that it's your first day and there's already more than one option of things you screwed up is not a good thing. Jonah: Okay, I've made some mistakes. I can admit that, but that doesn't mean we can't have a little fun at work, does it? Or try and find some moments of beauty in the everyday? Amy: Wait, I'm sorry. Did you really just use the phrase \"moments of beauty,\" like, conversationally? Jonah: Okay, yes, that's cheesy, but do you remember \"American Beauty\"? Even a plastic bag can be breathtaking. Amy: Wow. That really blew my mind. Like, boom, I have goose bumps. Jonah: I felt something. I'm Jonah. It's my first day.  Cheyenne: Okay. Stay still. Dina: I don't usually wear eyeliner. Sharpie occasionally, but... Cheyenne: So tell me about this special guy. Dina: Okay. Male, Caucasian, no discernible scars or tattoos. Cheyenne: Sounds dreamy. Dina: Yeah. Cheyenne: You know, speaking of boys, I've got a pretty big decision to make. My boyfriend, he... Dina: I'm glad we could bond like this. Thank you. Mateo: Excuse me, excuse me! Hi! I hung up everything that was in the dressing rooms, and I organized it by style, color, size, and relevance of designer. Amy: Wow. Good job. Mateo: I enjoy hard work. It's just like my mom always said: \"If you don't work hard, Baby Jesus will cry.\" Amy: Okay. Mateo: I don't think I could be happy fooling around in the parking lot like the other new guy.  Jonah: Slow down! This is not fair! You have more experience on wheels than I do! Garrett: Your disability is not my concern! Amy: Seriously? The only thing I asked you to do was put the carts away. Jonah: That's what I'm doing, just somewhat circuitously. Garrett: See you later, sucka! Amy: Are you trying to get fired? What if Glenn sees this? Glenn: Coming through! Move! Jonah: That doesn't count. Glenn: Go, Glenn! Yeah! Yeah! Yes! In your faces! Your faces! Ha-ha! Amy: Okay. I get it. You're the fun guy. I'm the stick in the mud. Well, I could be fun. I could have fun. Let's have fun. Jonah: Of course you can have fun. Amy: Whoo! We're playing at work. Jonah: No brakes! I have no brakes! No ooh!  Amy: Peace offering. Jonah: Are those the flowers that I picked up off the floor of the garden center? Amy: Yes. Jonah: They're beautiful trash flowers. Amy: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I have been having a long day. Ten years of long days, actually. You know, I stock these glow stars every single year for the back-to-school sale. And then I take them down, and I put up the Halloween inventory, and then Thanksgiving and Christmas and Valentine's Day and Easter and Fourth of July, and then back-to-school again. Jonah: Hmm. That sounds incredibly not fun. I see why you love it here. Amy: It's a good job. But tomorrow is gonna be just like today, and I know that because today is just like yesterday. So sometimes it's just kind of hard to find those moments of beauty.  Garrett: Attention, shoppers. Even a big box store has to close, and it's about that time. You know, when Pandora closed her famous box, there was only one thing left inside - hope. I wonder what will be left inside of this box. Could it be Grace? I hope not. If you're Grace's parents, please pick her up at customer service.  Mateo: I took the initiative upon myself to reorganize the toy section for the convenience of adult shoppers. It was just feeling overly whimsical. Jonah: I want to show you something I've been working on. Mateo: Oh. You were working. Where? Because I've been in every single department, and I haven't seen you in a couple hours, unless you were in, like, the break room maybe. Bo: Everybody get down on the ground, now! Get down, get down, get down! Touch the ground! Or get out! All right, calm down. Do what I say, and nobody gets hurt. Dina: This is what I trained for. Bo: Now, I'm gonna start killing somebody every minute, unless unless you agree to marry me, Cheyenne. Hit it! Garrett: Hey, what the... Bo: I'll say, \"Will you marry me?\" Jonah: I had nothing to do with this. Amy: Yeah, I know. This is the fault of YouTube. Bo: Heard you want to walk down the aisle. Your baby needs a daddy, we've been bangin' for a while. All right, I pay the consequences of my actions. Don't try to change me 'cause I'm a man of action. Glenn: Yo! What a show. Dina: I'm calling to report a code green in progress. I repeat, code green. Operator: What's a code green? Dina: I faxed you a list of codes last month! Hostage situation! You need to get SWAT down here right now! Bo: When all these people gonna learn? We're gonna get burned, just waiting for our turn. Yo, #BlackLivesMatter, y'all. Okay, if you like what you heard and saw, I'm currently seeking representation in all areas. Also, I do modeling, so I'm just throwing that out there. All right, peace out, St. Louis. Cheyenne: Bo! Bo: What? Oh, my bad, yo. Cheyenne Tyler Lee, will you marry me? Or are you gonna be, like, a dick about it? Dina: Oh, I think he's about to shoot a hostage. I'll do what I can. Operator: Don't do anything. Amy: What is this? Jonah: Moment of beauty?  Garrett: To Cheyenne. All: Cheers! Garrett: May your marriage be as sweet and colorful as this Cloud 9 brand caffeinated malt beverage, without the recall for killing college students. Cheyenne: Thank you, on behalf of myself and Bo. Amy: Well, he did make it memorable. I'll give him that. Jonah: I mean, most guys don't even bother threatening to kill you when they propose. Dina: You were never in any real danger. You know that, right? Jonah: Yeah, I know. It was a fake robbery. Dina: This is a high-velocity 440-grain lead flat-nose projectile with gas checks and a boxer-primed brass jacket. If he'd come within 10 feet of you, you would have seen his head explode like a watermelon. Cleanup on aisle I don't even know what aisle it is, 'cause his brains would be splattered all over the sign. Oh, shoot. Cheyenne: You know, I wish that we could wear jewelry at work. Amy: Oh, it's so sparkly. Cheyenne: You know, I thought about what you said about not doing something that I might regret, but then, in the moment, you know, under the stars, it just felt right. Without you, I would have never said yes, so thank you. Jonah: Oh. Cheyenne: Well, I should go bail out my boyfriend now. Or I mean bail out my fiancé! Glenn: Aw. Amy: All right. I got to get going. Good night, everyone. All: Good night. Jonah: Hey, wait up. Wait up. Hey, I didn't mean to... that, in there... I just wanted today to feel different than yesterday. Amy: Well, then you completely failed, because that exact same thing happened yesterday. But thank you. Jonah: Okay. Amy: I really do have to get going. See you at work tomorrow, Jonah? Jonah: You certainly will champ. Amy: Amy. Jonah: Nice to meet you, Amy. Garrett: Yo, you should come with us, man. We're gonna throw some mannequin limbs in the dumpster and watch garbage men freak out. Jonah: That sounds awesome. Garrett: It is awesome. Come on. \n",
      "GARY  Thats a fork, Madam Vice President.  SELINA  Thanks for the debrief, Gary.  ANNA  -..and the VP also needs to meet with  Senator Hallowes. Ten minutes, preferably  20, and you might want to make that  happen in the next five minutes,  preferably two.  GARY  I meant its one of the new cornstarch  forks. I was differentiating it from the  spork...  The hybrid spoon-fork.  ANNA  Im just wondering if your imminent  meeting on Senate vote reform might be  more important than a spoon-fork?  SELINA  Sure, but you know how slowly that stuff  goes. Like fucking stop-motion animation:  eliminate anonymous holds here, sliding  scales for cloture there - just a whole  bunch of procedural clit-diddling.  But this is classic - are you  Listening...?  ANNA  I am. Im one huge ear, tuned only to the  frequency of your voice.  SELINA  This is classic Clean Jobs Commission  stuff - biodegradable cornstarch utensils  in most government buildings by the fall.  Real stuff...  .»-shit, do these not bend back?  GARY  Theyve not perfected that yet, Maam.  SELINA  Great. Theres my first speech as Chair  of the Clean Jobs Commission: weve come  up with a way for people to eat round  corners.  ANNA  Okay...  SELINA  Whats wrong. You used okay like a  swearword.  ANNA  Brett Kagans blog. He's picked up on a  cutlery tweet from our Twitter guys.  SELINA  Is this chopsticks, are he saying we're  anti-Asian...?  ANNA  A tweet yesterday said 76 percent of  government buildings now have cornstarch  utensils! Let's make it 100! Lets make  plastic utensils extinct!  SELINA  Oh, fuck a duck.  ANNA  Kagan's publicized it, plastics industry  are already going crazy, they want  meetings and statements today.  SELINA  Of course they do. Which Club Class  jerkoff tweeted that?  ANNA  Well, officially, you. It was written by  a staffer, but as Selina Meyer.  4 @ SELINA  There are seven of me in that office,  which me wrote it? Glasses me? Tall me?  Gay bald me?  ANNA  I think it was gluten-intolerant me.  SELINA  Ryan? Well, iets fire gluten-intolerant  me. Get smelly me to do it.  ANNA  And I1l set up a meeting with the  Plastics & Cellulose Association. Okay?  SELINA  Sure. I'm living the dream. Only its  that dream where Im meeting men who work  in plastics.  ANNA  They're pretty powerful men.  SELINA  No. They work for powerful companies. The  men themselves look like Pee Wee Herman.  © Gary holds up a knife.  GARY  Do you want to see the cornstarch knife?  ANNA  Fuck the knife Gary.  SELINA  Yes, on balance Gary, fuck the knife.  Selina holds her temples, closes her eyes. Gary reaches  into the big bag and brings out two packs of pills.  GARY  Codeine or Ibuprofen?  SELINA  Codeine.  GARY  Would you like them to switch off the  sirens?   SELINA   No, no, put them back on.  SELINA  I mean when these guys were kids, were  they like, I want to work with plastic.  Screw being an astronaut, or Donny  Osmond, or Kissinger - my ambition is to  make the least interesting part of a  cotton bud. And maybe hound the Vice  President.  am  —  SELINA   Hello Senators.  GARY  Okay, over there is Senator Alice Dorsey.  Husband died two years ago and daughter  Emily just graduated Harvard.  SELINA  Which one is she again?  GARY  Two o'clock.  SELINA  Im not a frigging sniper, Gary.  GARY  Red dress. Slight mustache. Tiny lips.  SELINA  Okay, thank you.   6 O  SELINA   Alice! Hi! So glad you could make it!  How's Emily?  SENATOR DORSEY  She's good, thank you.  ANNA  Is this cutlery thing making the Veep  toxic? There are more serving staff here  than Senators.  SENATOR DORSEY  I see cutlery is getting some serious  traction. Not worried by the plastic  people?  SELINA  Plastic people? Makes them sound like GI  Joe dolls, with no genitals.  SENATOR DORSEY  _ ©) I wouldn't know, I grew up with sisters.  These are good people Selina. Theyve  given the party a lot of funding,  genitals or no.  SELINA  And I dont have a problem with that.  After all, in Ancient Rome the wealth was  controlled by the eunuchs, right?  Where is everyone? Weren't we discussing  one~filibuster-per-bill today?  SENATOR DORSEY  Were all excited by your Re-energizing  Floor Procedure agenda. Its just -  theres a vote coming up, and...  SELINA  No, sure. Why should my meeting about the  need to have more votes get in the way of  having a vote?  SENATOR DORSEY  Im guessing you're posing a rhetorical  question.  SELINA  ay Why wouldnt I? SELINA   I dont want to be here. Make me not be  here.  ANNA  We picked a bad time. It's the vote.  SELINA  Its not the vote, its the cutlery. This  is plastic money.  GARY  Credit cards?  SELINA  They all get funded by the plastics  industry, some clownfish tweets about  cornstarch forks and suddenly Im like a  leper with a dirty bomb in one hand and a  sign in the other saying I Hate  Plastic. Jeez, look at it...  This is embarrassing. This room is  emptier than Garys life. No offence.  GARY  None taken.  SELINA  I meant youre life is totally devoted to  me...  GARY  ..so doesn't require filling. Thats why  I took no offence Maam.  SELINA  Even Hallowes isnt here. And shes one  of my closest political friends. Bitch.  Right, I want a tunnel out of this  meeting.  ANNA  Shall we do a Fax And Go?  Gary nods and Selina moves over to a group of Senators.  SELINA  Senators, I'm really sorry but something  pretty major has just broken. Gary?  GARY  This has just come in, and it looks big.  SELINA  Yep - something large and unusual has  come up and Im going to have to head  back. I am the Vice President, so...that  happens.  GARY  Do you want to go back to the office?  SELINA  They're expecting us to be gone for two  hours. The press will notice.  ANNA  We could kill some time. We could walk  slowly to the East Gate, thats 15  minutes. Drive back by the river.  SELINA  Okay, we walk the wrong way, but  purposefully, like we're discussing  important shit. You and Gary surround me.  ANNA  You want us to form a human motorcade?  SELINA  It says here 65,000 Americans are  employed in the plastics industry and Im  like Jack The Ripper but with a  cornstarch knife.   ANNA  Are you self-Googling?  SELINA  I want to know what people are saying  about me.  ANNA  You dont. Really. Dont search on your  name, or your nicknames. Really dont.  SELINA  My nicknames?  ANNA  You have some nicknames that its  necessary for us to search on...  SELINA  What are they?  ANNA  Really? Okay: Grisly Madam, Meyer the  Liar, The Batcave, Mammary Meyer...  SELINA  Is that the breastfeeding legislation?  GARY  It is, Maam.  ANNA  And then just various VP things: Vaguely  Personable, Viagra Prohibitor and Visible  Panties.  SELINA  I'm sorry - I prohibit Viagra? Because -  what, because of my looks? Am I hideous?  GARY  Its just using those initials...  SELINA  Yes, to say that a chemical pill which  guarantees to produce a strong, sustained  erection in all men, whatever their age  or medical history, is nullified by me.  Don't searching that nickname again.  ANNA  No, of course.  DAN  So this would be where Senator Hallowes  might meet lobbyists or constituents to  discuss any issues they might have.  CONSTITUENT  She got rid of that emergency trailer  park pretty quick. Those bastards wont  be coming back.  DAN  Anna.  ANNA  Dan.  DAN  You look like youre on your way to  somewhere important.  DAN   Honoured to meet you Madam Vice  President. Im Dan Egan, Im with Senator  Hallowes.  SELINA  Well tell her to put on her chemical  suit, because Im coming over to see her.  Anna, you want to....?  CONSTITUENT  Madam Vice President, great privilege to  meet you. Can we talk to you about the  Mexicans?  SELINA  Sure.  Are my panties visible? GARY  No maam. I havent seen them.  Selina discretely checks her skirt. Dan takes Anna to one  side.  ANNA  So, Dan, are you a tour guide now? If  always knew youd make it to the top.  DAN  How was your bosss meeting? I hear the  catering was a box of a dozen donuts.  ANNA  Fuck you.  DAN  I hadnt finished...and four of those  were left over.  ANNA  I hadnt finished either...Fuck you Dan.  You dick. OK, thats the small talk  done. We know Hallowes is avoiding the  Veep.  C DAN  Of course she is. Veep?  ANNA  We're pushing Veep as her acceptable  nickname.  DAN  You mean instead of She-Ra?  ANNA  We need 20 minutes with Senator Hallowes.  DAN  There are a lot of people who need 20  minutes with probably the next Chair of  Finance. Take ticket number 89 and..  ANNA  The Veeps thinking of offering the  Senator a post on her Clean Jobs  Commission.  DAN  After this plastics thing I think the  Senator might prefer to attend something  less contentious, like a Klan meeting.  _ ANNA  Come on Dan. Did what we had together  mean nothing to you? DAN  You know it didnt.  ANNA  You remember the restaurant.  DAN  Its my regular second-date  restaurant.   Ladies and gentlemen.   ANNA  Its the SRVA Fundraiser tonight.  ANNA   How would you like to stand right next to  the President?  DAN  She gets 10 minutes.  SENATOR HALLOWES  I still support him. It was an ill-  advised comment about offshore funds and,  you know, Franks Chair of the Finance  Committee so he needs to watch what he  says...  SENATOR HALLOWES   But, look, we've all said dumb things in  our lives and I dont think this is a  resigning issue for Frank. Okay. Goodbye.   DAN  Now all that guy will take from the call  will be the words dumb and resigning.  CF SENATOR HALLOWES  Thanks Dan.  Selina!   SELINA  Hi Barbara. Youre not returning my  calls. You been seeing another VP behind  my back?  DAN  The Senator has been very busy with  extremely important legislative business.  SENATOR HALLOWES  You must remember what that was like,  Selina, from when you were a Senator?   SELINA  You shafting Frank to get Chair of  Finance? I remember that from my Senate  ©) days.  SENATOR HALLOWES  Yep. Officially supporting hin,  unofficially positioning to take over  after his sure-fire resignation tomorrow  afternoon.  SELINA  The usual dance. Gary, could you get me a  coffee from the machine?  GARY  Oh, Ive managed to get a fresh batch of  those European sweeteners you like so  much. The French sweeteners?  SELINA  Thanks Gary. Youre phenomenal. Theyre  great, great sweeteners.   SELINA    I don't like them especially, they taste  just like any other sweetener. Sweet.  Its not like wine, you dont say, mmn,  = sweetener - I'm getting oak, maybe a hint  of raspberries and, my, is that fennel?  No, its just a harsh chemical sweetener,  but Gary puts so much effort into getting  them I dont have the heart to tell the  poor bastard.   SENATOR HALLOWES  So, I love what youre doing with the  whole cutlery thing.  DAN  You got Google alerts on all the VPs  nicknames? Mrs Doubtmeyer, you got that?  ANNA   Yes.  DAN  Thats a clever one, because it implies  shes both nannying and confused.  ANNA  So Hallowes is going to get the Chair of  the Finance Committee from Frank?  DAN  Probably. She wont be very good at it  though. Theyll want Frank back.  ANNA  Okay. Indiscreet?  DAN  She wouldn't believe you over me so I can  be honest. Senator Hallowes is mediocre.  If they did greetings cards that said  Youre basically adequate, thats what  people would send her.  SELINA  Dan seems good.  SENATOR HALLOWES  Hes great. Very loyal.   SENATOR HALLOWES   Got him from an Ohio Congresswoman. She  was clearly going nowhere. You know hes  dating my daughter?  SELINA  Janet?  SENATOR HALLOWES  No.   SELINA  Sorry, of course not. I meant...  Carol. Carol Hallowes.  GARY  I got you a double sleeve. Always err on  the side of caution. And two sweeteners.   SELINA  So ~ you saw my letter inviting you on to  the Clean Jobs Commission? Its going to  be big - my stamp on this administration.  SENATOR HALLOWES  Yes, I saw the letter. Anna forges your  signature brilliantly.  SELINA  She does it so well sometimes I think I  use her version of my signature when I  sign my own name. Which I did. So why are  you avoiding me?  SENATOR HALLOWES  Isnt it obvious?  SELINA  You seriously think plastics will pull  funding over this?  SENATOR HALLOWES  What is plastic made of, Selina? You piss  ey off plastic, you piss off oil.  And I do not want to fuck with those  guys. Because they fuck in a very  unpleasant fashion.  SELINA  Jesus, does everything in this town have  to come down to money? Why cant we go  back to the old days, when we just  swapped land for beads?  SENATOR HALLOWES  Because, now we'd be controlled by the  bead industry. I need to get going.  DAN  Nice bag Gary.  ANNA  He calls it The Leviathan.  DAN  You got the nuclear codes in there?  GARY  Ha, yes, you see, what I have in here may  seem trivial but it is far from trivial.  He takes out two small tins.  GARY   See? Two types of lip salve - one is  ordinary, everyday, regular salve. But if  the Veep is in too many air-conditioned  rooms her lips get radically dry, and she  needs the heavy-duty stuff. Without it,  she cant talk. Literally, its too  painful for her to speak words.  DAN  And I guess if she cant talk that could  result in anything. Maybe war?  GARY  Very funny, Dan, but not so very far from  the truth. I do a serious job.  DAN  And those guys who say youre just an old  man holding a lady's purse - screw them?  ANNA  Dan - play nice.  DAN  Would you take a bullet for the VP?  GARY  Well, thats the security guys. My job  would be to help her when shes down.  Staunch the bleeding, get her painkillers  and, you know...  DAN  Lip salve, right. In case she gets shot  in the lips.  ANNA  Dan. Give me the ball.  DAN  But youre the one constantly by her  side, so if someone were to shoot at  her...you know...  GARY  Okay...  DAN  You ready for that? Hot, fast metal  ripping your internal organs apart. It  aint Shiatsu.  SENATOR HALLOWES  Oh, you know Senator Reeves died?  SELINA  Retard Reeves? He must have been...91?  SENATOR HALLOWES   SELINA  He was the first Senator to welcome me to  the Capitol. He was old even then.  ANNA  Was he full of wisdom? SELINA  He was full of Bourbon and he touched my  left boob.  ANNA  God rest his soul.  SENATOR HALLOWES  Did you fire your tweeting guy? Because  he is a weapons-grade retard. I think you  might have been hoist by your own  retard there!  Selina laughs. Senator Hallowes marches off. Dan lingers  a bit.  DAN  By the way, I really admired your  campaign, sorry you didnt get the  nomination.   SELINA  Thank you. I agree, I think we fought a  good campaign.  DAN  Two things I would have done differently,  but youve probably been over those with  Anna.  SELINA  Two things? What were they?  DAN  Shouldnt have spent so much time in New  Hampshire, that was in the bag, and  attack ads in Oregon were four days too  early, it looked like you were mean  before you had to be. But look, I'm  teaching my grandmother to suck eggs  here.  Mother...big sister to suck eggs.  SELINA  Interesting. Good to meet you Dan.  Selina and Gary head off.  DAN  See you at the fundraiser.  ANNA  Yup, dont forget your plus one.  DAN  Yup, plus one.   ANNA  = So, did the Senator take the Clean Jobs  post?  SELINA   What do you think of Dan?  ANNA  Dan is a shit.  SELINA  Okay, want to expand on that?  ANNA  Hes a massive and total shit. When you  first meet him, you think, surely to God  this man cant be as big a shit as he  seems. But he is.  SELINA  See, I...  ANNA  Its like, if you were to see a book with  covers made of shit, you'd think, thats  intriguing. I wonder what's in this book  that they saw fit to give it covers made  of pure shit. Then you open it and -  shit.  SELINA  I think hes OK. I think we could use him  for...lets just say, I think Senator  Hallowes has made herself a very powerful  enemy.  ANNA  Who?  SELINA  Me!  ANNA  Yes, you. Of course.  GARY  Absolutely, you.  SELINA  Im the powerful enemy.  ANNA  Hey Mike - off to give the 3:30?  MIKE  Yeah. I heard about the cutleryfuck at  the Capitol. Thanks everyone.  ANNA  Yeah, go polish that turd, Mike.  MIKE  And the plastic guy - what do you plan to  say to him?  SELINA  Okay, well I guess my main...  MIKE  Actually, dont tell me. If I genuinely  dont know, the bastards cant make me  tell them. You know my motto: I Dont  Want To Know And Anyway What Motto, I  Have No Motto.  SELINA  Jonah.  JONAH  Madam Vice President.  ANNA  I know you only do that to look cool and  get the giris.  MIKE  You look like the guy from My Left Foot.  Selina goes through into her private office.  JONAH  The President lets me smoke out of the  White House briefing room window, and  that opens the whole way.  GARY  That ones an anti-suicide window.  JONAH  They only put it in when you joined,  right Gary?  GARY  No.  ANNA  How many times have you spoken to the  President today, Jonah? You need to  remember so you can put it up on your  star chart on the refrigerator.  JONAH  Four times. In the briefing room, in the  hallway, NSC meeting, in the hallway  again.  MIKE  Is that as he was trying to throw you out  of the NSC meeting?  JONAH  The President knows my name Mike. I doubt  he remembers yours.  ANNA  You know he attaches an image to a name  to make it easier to remember?  So for you - Jonah - hed think of a  whale, because youre called Jonah and  you look like a whale.  JONAH  So, Anna, good new Italian place opened  downtown. You like Italian?  ANNA  I love Italian Jonah. But still,  unfortunately, really dislike you.  JONAH  Hey, I'm not asking you out. That wasnt  a knockback because I didnt ask you out.  ANNA  Jonah, you know I will never go out with  you. I would rather go out with Gary than  go out with you and I would never in a  million years go out with Gary. Isnt  that right, Gary?  GARY  Right. Youve said this many a time.   SELINA  Jonah, you are, I know, a very busy and  important 24-year-old. So why have you  come to see us?  JONAH  The White House would like you to go to  tonights SRVA fundraiser instead of the  President.  SELINA  Why?  JONAH  Hed rather not be open to questioning  tonight. Frank's remarks about off-shore  accounts and curbing business tax breaks  were obviously absolutely correct, but he  will be resigning tomorrow.  Pharmaceuticals and the Roundtable are  flapping, we need to throw them a  cuttlefish. SELINA  Apt food metaphor, given theres no  backbone involved. Sorry, Jonah, I'd love  to go up there and publicly contradict my  beliefs, but I have my own agenda space  to tend to.  JONAH  The President is very keen that your  going to the fundraiser should be,  fundamentally, the sequence of events  that does actually take place this  evening.  Selina has no option.  SELINA  Let me make a cail.   JONAH  You need to be there too Mike, so no  going home to walk the dog. Make sure the  VP doesnt mention cornstarch, plastics,  fossil fuels or any type of organic or  inorganic compound whatsoever.  MIKE  Dont tell me what to do, Doogie fucking  Howzer.  JONAH  I dont know what that means. Or the left-  foot thing. And I can fucking tell you  what to do because one of us backed the  winning candidate in the Presidential  nominations.   Let me text you the name of that someone  who does now work for the President...  and not for the candidate who lost.   MIKE  Jungle.  JONAH  Jonah. Its predictive text. You know  what I wrote. I wrote my name.  MIKE  Okay Jungle.  SELINA  Right, Ive cancelled my date. Anna, we  should get a speech and some jokes  together.  JONAH  Jokes?  SELINA  Just some gags to liven things up. Anna  will come up with some.  ANNA  Maybe not jokes as such. Maybe more a  light touch. Like Ugly Betty - its not  technically a comedy, but it has a light  touch.  JONAH  No, no jokes. These are not humorous  times for America.  Jonah leaves.  SELINA  You know, Im wondering just how hard  Ill weep when that guy gets his  embolism.  ANNA  Okay, lets turn this - use tonight's  speech for your Re-energizing Floor  Procedure agenda.  SELINA  Right. Lets float my idea about cloture  change needing 41 to prevent instead of  60 to invoke.  ANNA  You dont seriously expect me to come up  with jokes about that?  Mike heads out.  MIKE  Ill go and check if the press room's  ready for the fireball about to hit them.  SELINA  Mike - what were my two big campaign  Mistakes, would you say?  MIKE  You looked tired a lot of the time? And  that hat? SELINA  You dont think one of them was that we  went too soon with attack ads in Oregon?  MIKE  Who knows about that shit? Anyway, we got  here in the end.  ANNA  Okay, Senator Clements is here, you  should definitely talk to her. And Bill  Knight from the Speaker's office.  MIKE  Ooch, little burgers. Great. Four of those  make a normal one.  ANNA  I assume youre taking some of those home  for your dog?  SELINA  What utensils do they have here? I cant  be seen using cornstarch over plastic. Or  plastic over cornstarch.  MIKE  You could use celery as a kind of shovel?  SELINA  Bring me some lentil salad, I11 go in  the corner and eat it with my fingers.  GARY  I expect this is a fairly low-risk event,  yeah? All-ticket affair?  WOMAN  Pretty much. Theres usually one or two  unknowns.  GARY  Unknowns?  WOMAN  You guys with Kate?  The men nod.  WOMAN   Okay.  Youre not terrorists are you, cos Kate  knows a lot of terrorists!  MIKE  They deliberately dont give you a plate  at these things to discourage you from  getting a free dinner. But I always say -  the forearm is nature's plate.   MIKE   By the way, Im Mike.  SELINA  Do you have my notes Anna?  ANNA  Gary has them.   SELINA  Notes please Gary.  SELINA   Gary?  GARY  Sorry maam - do you need me?  SELINA  I need my notes. Why are you over there?  MIKE  Take a hike kid.  LITTLE GIRL  Im sorry sir?  MIKE  Take a hike. Defcon one.  SELINA  Distinguished ladies and gentlemen...   ---and Tom!   SELINA   Aaahm. These are serious times. And in  serious times we require an effective  legislature. Im reminded tonight of the  late Senator David Reeves...  SELINA   He died. Hes dead now. And I remember  him talking to me about the absurdity of  allowing multiple filibusters on a single  bill. In his words...  JONAH  This isnt quite the Gettysburg Address.  DAN  Its more a recreation of the tragic  events that led to it.  ANNA  Could you two shut your mouths?  It's that red and yellow hole you use  when you sieve carbohydrates through your  pubey 15-year-olds beard.  JONAH  Im sorry. Are you having difficulty  hearing the other 200 people talking over  your boss?  JONAH   That your date?  DAN  Thats the woman Im with tonight, yes.  JONAH  She's nice. An eight. Definite eight. I  used to get sixes, now Im in the White  House I get eights.  DAN  Ive never seen you with an eight.  JONAH  Oh, I get eights, believe me. Im up to  my neatly trimmed nuts in eights...  DAN  So, who do you know?  ANNA  Carol Hallowes? How do you even say that?  Carol Hallowes. Hallo Carol Hallowes!  DAN  You know I did promise her she'd be three  feet away from the President tonight. ANNA  What a shame - shes going to have to be  content with being, what?   ...three and a half inches away from you  later?  DAN  That doesnt work. As a joke. The penis,  whatever size, is inserted into the  vagina. So she would be the same distance  from me if my penis were small or huge.   ANNA  Hallo Carol Hallowes!  CUT TO:  Selinas still speaking.  SELINA  With a Senate logjam like we currently  have, hundreds of bills are getting  stalled, which means millions...  JONAH  What are you doing?  ANNA  I'm giving her the signal to make a joke.  JONAH  Dont, shes in enough trouble.  ANNA  Get your hand off me you freak!   ANNA   And dont tell people you got to first  base with me, because that wasnt first  base. That was assault.   SELINA  So, Ill let you all get back to enjoying  yourselves.  Actually talking of enjoyment, and  leisure, I just booked a holiday in  Florida. Wonder if that makes me the  Miami Vice President!? Or...  Okay, thank you for listening and...  HECKLER  You going to be tweeting about this?  SELINA  Ha! If thats a reference to the rogue  cutlery tweet - I'm afraid that there we  were very much hoist by our own retard!  Thank you so much.  SELINA   Do people not listen any more? So rude.  ANNA  Maam...the last remark you made...  DAN  The word retard.  SELINA  It's not that bad a word, is it?  ANNA  It will be deemed offensive to anyone  with learning difficulties. Yes maam.  DAN  This will soon be getting on the blogs.  SELINA  What? Shit - how? I just said it like a  second ago. Fuck broadband.  ANNA  Maam, the President of AT&T is in the  room.   ANNA   Mike, put the crabcakes down, we have a  situation with the Vice President. MIKE  A situation with the Vice President?  GARY  Oh God! Is she down? I should have been  there!  SELINA  This is not my fault.  DAN  I cant access Kagans blog. Is it down?  ANNA  No, not your fault maam. I cant access  Kagan either. Someone punch the AT&T guy.  SELINA  This is your boss. She was using that  word so much this morning ~ retard  this, retard the other - it was like  Hurricane Retard. It fixed it in my head.  DAN  Theres a way to mend this. Tomorrow  morning you meet with someone amenable  from a mental health charity. I have a  lot of contacts.  SELINA  I imagine you probably do. You're a hub.  A nexus the size of Texas. Talk to Anna.   ANNA  Appreciate your input Dan but fuck off.  She needs to call the Association of  Mental Health Charities right now, not  tomorrow, and apologise. DAN  No! Calm things down. More haste, less  speed.  ANNA  The way I see it, more haste, more haste.  We need haste here.  DAN  Larry, Moe - let Curly in first.  SELINA  Yes, thats right, so I was wanting to  apologise over some comments that I...uh-  huh, sure, I'll hold.   Im holding. Actually, what if they  haven't heard about it yet. What if the  mental people havent heard the retard  comments?  ANNA  Well, they will hear eventually so...  SELINA  You think they'll definitely hear?  MIKE  They might not hear. What if Tom Hanks  dies?  ANNA  What?  MIKE  Just a for-instance - what if Tom Hanks  dies? Thats all that will be on the news  for like a week.  SELINA  Hes right, they1l be going with the  cutlery thing tomorrow. Plastics is worse  than retard. I think its worse. Is it?  Fuck, I dont know any more. Should I  hang up?   MIKE  Okay, how about - we let the retard thing  blow up. It was a silly word, we  apologise, but its the main story, so  we've drowned out plastics?  ANNA  Mike, the press didnt stop writing about  Hiroshima just because the Nagasaki thing  blew up.  GARY  Codeine or Ibuprofen?  SELINA  Both. Plus that stuff they use in lethal  injections.  Yes, hi, just one second...  They've de-held me, Im loose, Ive gone  rogue. What do I say?   SELINA    Yes, hi, I was mentioning to your  colleague, what happened was I used the  word retard in a...retard, yes. In a  humorous context. No, I know, that is why  Im apologising now....  ANNA  I think were going to need you to puil  an all-nighter on this Mike.  MIKE  I cant. The dog.  SELINA  Go home. Feed the dog. Walk the dog.  Shoot the dog. Bury the dog. Come back  in.  MIKE  Actually, maybe...the dog will be fine.  MIKE  It was a reference to a petard. No, not  Star Trek - petard.   ANNA  Okay, set up new Google alerts for VP.  Meyer offensive, Meyer retard, Meyer  resigning issue. Then delete your  History.   JONAH  Okay, why the huge retard panic? The  retard thing's not as bad as cutlery.  ANNA  The Veep apologised last night about the  retard thing.  JONAH  What? She put it out there? Okay, heres  a couple more News Alerts for you then:  try VP worse than the Jonestown  massacre and VP 9/11 point 2'.  ANNA  I havent got time to ignore you Jonah.  Gary, could you ignore Jonah for me?  GARY  I assume you're joking Anna. Hi Jonah.  What do you have there?   JONAH  Condolence card, for Senator Reeves  widow. The President's already signed, so  if Selina could too, while she still has  a job? Then I11l send it round the Hill.   DAN  Anna, this is Paul Burton, Chair of the  American Association of Mental Health  Charities.  PAUL  Hi.  SELINA  Mr Burton. Why dont you come through to  my office. Gary, could you fix some  coffee?  GARY  Yes maam.   JONAH  Maam, I have a condolence card here for  Senator Reeves widow...  ANNA  What was that gesture? Ive never seen  her give that gesture.   JONAH  Is she not going to sign this card?  ANNA  Ill sign the card. Thats what her  gesture was to me, to do her signature on  this. What was her gesture to you Dan?  DAN  Im not sure I noticed a gesture.   ANNA  Can you not stand so close Jonah, you  stink of cigarettes.  JONAH  I smell like a man. All men used to smell  like this. Spencer Tracy used to smell  like this. Cary Grant. I smell like them.  DAN  Dead old men.  Gary emerges from Selinas office.  JONAH  You all smell of women, especially you  Gary.   GARY  Thatll be the VPs scented wipes.  Vanilla and rose.  ANNA  I know what youre doing Dan, okay?  DAN  Yes? What am I doing?  ANNA  I don't know, exactly, but I do know that  you are one sly fuck. You know Fantastic  Mr Fox? Thats you, only you're worse  than a fox. Youre Fantastic Mr Shit.  JONAH  Sorry to interrupt the pre-nup, but is  this card going to...?   ANNA  Im signing the fucking card.  MIKE  Hit the deck, fuckers! Brett Kagan's blog  is now saying the VP was calling Senator  Reeves a retard at the fundraiser.  DAN  Well, see, thats Kagan getting things  completely wrong. We can prove the VP  didn't say that and discredit him. Which  is why I planted that story with him in  the first place.  ANNA /MIKE  What the fuck...?  DAN  Its a dumb story anyway, and we also  show its unreliable, because it comes  from a blogger whos a news slut. He  shuts down, cutlery moves to page 10,  retard moves to page 5,and on page 1 we  have Bloggers Eat Babies.  GARY  I dont understand. Are you meant to be  clever?  DAN  Its brilliant Gary. And it gets better.  What you need to do, Mikey, at the 11:30  press call today is make it clear there  were two people - the VP and Senator  Hallowes - involved in Retardgate.  GARY  Can we not call it Retardgate? Can we  call it the R-word F-up?   DAN  I don't give a splayed fucking anus what  the fuck we call it you clumsy fucking  human tumour, weve got to deal with it,  okay? Now get on board, or I swear I'll  slice your tits off so Mike can take them  home for his dog. We need a body. And we  cant give them the Vice President.  MIKE  So we give them your boss? Are you doing  a thing, a clever double thing, or...?  DAN  Dont worry your meaty head, Mike, just  tell the press that Senator Hallowes  introduced the expression retard into  the conversation. And she encouraged -  strike - she goaded the VP into using it.  MIKE  You think Im going to do what you say?  Dan gets very close to Mike.  DAN  Ask yourself - do you think I1l end up  working in a position above you or below  you Mike? Every shred of ambition left  your body a long time ago and all youve  got left for the remaining 10 years of  your working life is a damp apartment,  cold dwarf-burgers from a buffet, and an  invisible fucking dog. Make a  calculation.  GARY  Oh, could you sign this customs form to  confirm that Selinas French sweeteners  weren't a gift? Not, if you will, a  sweetener.  ANNA  You, Gary, are as funny as...fuck.  GARY  Why thank you.  ANNA  No. Fuck. The condolence card. I think I  signed my own name. Not Selinas, mine.  GARY  How sure are you, on a scale of one to  ten, where one...  ANNA  I can work out how the fucking scale will  go Gary. Nine. Im nine sure that I  signed my name.  GARY  Nine. Thats almost the full ten.  ANNA  Okay. Not good. The VP couldn't be  bothered to sign a card for one of the  most revered Senators of the last 50  years. Selina cant know about this.  GARY  No.  ANNA  Gary...!  GARY  If shes going down, Ive got to catch  her.  ANNA  Why did you tell her? You lunatic. Shes  going to turn into an apeshit crazy  person.  SELINA SELINA   This is insane. We've done Hiroshima and  Nagasaki. We're doing Chernobyl as well?  ANNA  I'm so sorry. I ..  SELINA  I need every Senator on side to get  reform through and you give me this?  Senator's are fucking prickly people,  Anna. I know. I used to be a big fucking  prickly Senator.  ANNA  I'm so sorry. Well get the card back.  SELINA  Yes you will. Now get on with it, because  Im busy in there apologising.   SELINA   Sorry, how where...   ANNA  Mike, a truckload of fuck has just been  unloaded all over this office.  MIKE  Man, this is too much information.  MIKE  I need you to know Im not happy about  giving this briefing.  DAN  And I need you to know that I couldn't  give a shit.  MIKE  Is this going to be like Moonlighting  where we end up falling in love with each  other and fucking?  DAN  No, more like The Wire, where I end up  blowing your brains out. And then like  Dexter, where I cut you into little  pieces and incinerate you. And then like  The West Wing, where I become President.  GARY  Im feeling a bit like, you know, the  Watergate burglars? I mean, this is...  ANNA  Dont be a dick Gary. With Watergate they  burgled party secrets, you're retrieving  a greetings card. OK? They forced illegal  entry, you have a pass that authorises  you to enter most of the White House.  SELINA  This isnt Watergate. This is walking  through a gate.  GARY  I need a long coat. To hide the card.  ANNA  You can borrow mine.  SELINA  Good luck Gary - take that bullet for me!  JONAH  Gary.  GARY  Jesus! Jonah! Hi.  JONAH  You're in my office.  GARY  Yes.  JONAH  What do you want? In my office.  GARY  Nothing at all. Just...I needed to see...  JONAH  Are you here to steal the card, Gary?  GARY  No sir, not at all.  JONAH  This looks bad Gary. This looks real bad.  And Im a friend of yours.  GARY  But it isnt bad. Im not bad.  JONAH  I knew the card had been incorrectly  signed. But I didnt say anything because  I wanted to use this knowledge for my  personal advantage.  GARY  Right.  JONAH  I will give you the card Gary. With  pleasure.  GARY  Thank you. Please get to the bad bit of  this because I know therell be one and I  don't like tension. I have acid reflux  issues.  JONAH  I want Anna to go on a date with me  tonight. We wont have sex, because she  hates me. But Anna is an eight, and if  the other eights I want to have sex with  see Im eight-capable, then I will have  some sex with an eight before too long. GARY  I'm sorry, but do I look like a pimp?   JONAH  You kind of do.  DAN  We've all said dumb things in our lives.  But I certainly dont think this is a  resigning issue for Senator Hallowes.  Okay. Goodbye.  Hi, Carol Hallowes please.   O Carol Hallowes. Yes, voicemail, thanks.   Carol, its Dan. I dont really know how  to say this...   -.-but I dont think, right now, I'm  ready to take that next step that we need  to take as a couple ...   ..-l mean, really, this is killing me,  this decision. Jesus. Im not eating...   ...its tearing me up.  Plus, you have a stupid fucking name.  DAN  Hey, big guy. Looks like Operation  Terrified Old Man went well. GARY  Jonah caught me. I had to make a deal.   ANNA  No she fucking isnt.  GARY  He doesnt want to sleep with you, just  dinner and a movie.  DAN  A date with stinky Jonah. Lucky you.  Youre getting him in his prime, before  next year's heart-lung transplant.  ANNA  Im not going out with Jonah.  SELINA  Get a grip. Its one date with no sex.  For me that was 12 years of marriage.  Okay, let me sign this thing. This has  gone from being a resigning issue, to a  re-signing issue. Thats a very clever  orthographic joke.  SELINA   Shit.  ANNA  Shit.  SELINA  The President already signed. We need to  forge the President's signature as well.  GARY  Isnt that still a capital offence? Can't  you be electrocuted for that?   DAN  Ill do it. The key is to do it upside  down.  SELINA  Wow. Dan - thank you. Is there anything  you cant do?  C) ANNA  Foreplay. Empathy.  DAN  Oh, and Senator Hallowes has let it be  known that she will not be putting her  name forward to replace the Chair of the  Finance Committee.  SELINA  Who's the baadass? Gary?  GARY  You are, Madam Vice President.  DAN  She also added she'll be taking a less  public role in future. So...  ANNA  Checking the mirror.  DAN  I guess that leaves me with a fatally  injured boss.  ANNA  Signalling.  DAN  And I wondered if there might be a  position in this office?  ANNA  And were moving off. Careful, you hit a  toddler.  SELINA  We should talk. I was thinking I'd like  to create a Special Director of  Communications role within this  department.  DAN  Uh-huh? Interesting.   ANNA  Excuse me - you just hired him? You hired  the biggest bastard in DC?  SELINA  Im fluent in bastard. Its one of my  languages. Dont worry about me.   ANNA  You? Im worried about me. I've worked  for you for nine years. I have...  SELINA  And I havent done anything for you? You  happen to be standing in the office of  the Vice President of the United States  young lady. I think thats pretty good.  ANNA  Young lady?  SELINA  I used Dan to get what I wanted.  ANNA  No, he used you to get what he wanted.  SELINA  No, I definitely used him. Im the u-ser,  hes the u-see. That's right, isnt it?  ANNA  Does he look used?   DAN  Nice desk, Gary.   MIKE  Duck and cover, everyone. This is the  front page of tomorrows Post.  JONAH  I just saw that - nice teeth. Madam Vice  President, you'll be relieved to hear the  President has decided to subsume the  Clean Jobs Commission into the DOE...  SELINA  He's done what?!  JONAH  -.-thus leaving you free to apply your  unique talents to other fields of  interest.   SELINA  Such as?  JONAH  The Mars Project?  SELINA  Great, that sounds like something  achievable in the next month. Get the  fuck out of here, little boy, before I  confiscate your prostate.  JONAH  Come on then Anna, shrimp linguine and a  porno. Im joking. Its chicken linguine.  Anna and Jonah leave.  ANNA  Touch me at this restaurant and you will  get metal cutlery in your eyes.  SELINA  You know Mike - whod have thought that  if you Tweet about cutlery and call a  dead senator a retard, its the cutlery  that comes to bite you?  MIKE  Reeves was a retard anyway.  SELINA  Yep. And, at least four times in his  distinguished Senate career, a rapist.  ANNA   Sorry maam, forgot to brief you. This is  Ken Nichol of the Plastics & Cellulose  Association. I'd booked him in for a four  o'clock.   SELINA  Mr Nichol.  Gary! Coffee! And two fucking sugars.  \n"

Or solitude? Or even love?  Amy: That\\'s actually a cubic zirconia knockoff. It\\'s called PlastiClear. Bo: What happened to the dollar 8 ones? Amy: We\\'re all sold out of those, sorry. But this one\\'s only dollar 2 more. Bo: I get it. You advertise the cheap jewelry to get the suckers in the door, then you push the expensive stuff. Amy: Well, I wouldn\\'t use the word \"suckers\" or \"expensive\" or \"jewelry\". Bo: Fine. I got to stand in line for cigarettes anyhow. Amy: Great. I hope you and your fiance are very happy together. And that you don\\'t procreate. Glenn? Glenn: Huh? Amy: I\\'m taking a mental-health break.  Glenn: Okay. Have fun now. Reflect.  Dina: Just checking over your new hire forms. American citizen. Nice. No dependents. Me neither, unless you count my birds. It just doesn\\'t say anywhere on here if you\\'ve got a girlfriend. Jonah: I didn\\'t, is there a space for that? Dina: There\\'s this section here, \"Is there anything else we should know?\" Some people like to volunteer it. Jonah: Oh. Umm, then also no. Dina: No. Jonah: No. Dina: Okay, well, I will just jot that down, then. But you are heterosexual, right? Jonah: Are you allowed to ask that? Dina: No. Amy: Smart. We always keep the best rolls right in the middle. Oh, wait. Jonah: No, no, no. Let me help you with that. Amy: Oh, no, no, no. I\\'m fine. Jonah: It\\'s fine, I work here. It\\'s, like, my it\\'s my job to help customers, so. Amy: You work here? Since when? Jonah: Since right now. I\\'m, it\\'s actually my first day. Amy: Oh. Jonah: I know. I don\\'t seem like the kind of person who would work in a place like this. Amy: Yeah, that\\'s why I was so surprised. I was like, \"What?\" \"What?\" \"Him?\" \"What\\'s he doing cleaning up toilet paper?\" I think it\\'s because you just you have this very intelligent, educated, more cultured quality, I mean, compared to yeah. Jonah: Oh, hey. Look, I get that you\\'re complimenting me, but it might sound a little condescending, so, you know. Amy: Oh, yeah, thanks. No, I wouldn\\'t want to sound condescending in front of somebody who works here. Jonah: Right. Cheyenne: Hey, can I run out for two minutes? This thing is kicking my bladder like it owes him money. Jonah: Oh, you know what, I\\'m actually not in charge. Amy: Yes, of course. I\\'ll take Carly off express. And Vivian can bag, so take as long as you need. Cheyenne: Ah, thanks. Amy: Little tip. Don\\'t let the other workers here know how much better than them you are. They hate that. I don\\'t know why, maybe because it sounds condescending. Welcome.  Dina: All right, campers, listen up. I\\'ve got an important announcement. This is your garden variety generic decongestant. And this is crystal meth, okay? The tweakers use this to make this. So stop selling them this, so they can\\'t make this. Cheyenne: That guy told me he had a really bad cold. Dina: He was buying 35 boxes, Cheyenne. That should have been a red flag, okay?

Jonah: Like, a person who thinks they\\'re better than ... you know what elitist means. Amy: Oh, yeah. They learnt that to us in public school. Glenn: Anyway, I am so proud to welcome two new angels to our Cloud 9 family. Why don\\'t you introduce yourselves? Okay. Jonah: Hello, everyone. I am Jonah. And I am I am excited to be here. This is gonna be fun, so. Mateo: My name is Mateo Fernando Aquino Liwanag, and I\\'m here to make something of myself. Spread my wings Whoo! See how far I can fly. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Dina: Yeah, you\\'re welcome. Glenn: I pray for you, Dina. Dina: I pray for you, too, Glenn. Glenn: No, I\\'m praying right now. Amy: I\\'m praying so hard. Glenn: I\\'m praying harder than you. I know how. So to welcome our new employees. Welcome. Welcome to Cloud 9. Garrett: This is my jam.  Jonah: Hey, do we have any kind of training? I\\'ve just been wandering from one department to another, trying to look like I have purpose. Garrett: It works better if you carry a box. There you go. See? You\\'ll learn as you go. Look, man, only a couple things to remember: always show up on time, don\\'t steal, and stay on the floor supervisor\\'s good side. Jonah: The floor, who\\'s the floor supervisor? Garrett: I got to go get another box. Jonah: Hey, can we can we start over? I\\'m Jonah, as you know. And you\\'re Ramona. Amy: Nope, that is not my name. I just don\\'t like random strangers using my name like we\\'re buddies. Jonah: Right, like how hookers don\\'t like to be kissed on the lips. Amy: Did you just compare me to a hooker? Jonah: No. Amy: You look bored. Let me help you with that. All electronics are supposed to be 25% off, but our POS system is down. So you scan, hit \"reassign,\" \"enter,\" \"override, yes,\" \"reduce 0.25,\" \"enter, yes, yes.\" You are not paying attention. Jonah: I\\'m sorry. Go ahead. Amy: \"Confirm,\" \"enter, yes.\" Got it? Jonah: If I guessed your name, would you tell me if I was right? Amy: Take this. Cheyenne: Oh, it\\'s so pretty! Jonah: I\\'ll make a list. Uptight Lady: Oh, excuse me, miss. Do you know the difference between a stool softener and a laxative? Amy: I\\'ll be right with you, ma\\'am. Cheyenne, what\\'s going on? Cheyenne: My boyfriend just asked me to marry him. UptightLady: I don\\'t want it soft. I want it out of me. Amy: You know, I hadn\\'t realized earlier that Cheyenne was the lucky girl you\\'d be proposing to. Bo: Yeah, well, I knocked her up, so my dad says I have to. Cheyenne: So romantic. Bo: That\\'s how I do it, yo. 100% love. UptightLady: Bulking agent? Why would I want more bulk? Ugh. Amy: Chey, you didn\\'t say yes, did you? Cheyenne: Why wouldn\\'t I say yes? Amy: Um Cheyenne, look at me. I know how easy it is to get swept up in the romance of all of this. But think it through, okay? Don\\'t do something you\\'re gonna regret for the rest of your life. UptightLady: Yeah, okay. I\\'m gonna go sleep on it.  Jonah: Hey. I think I got it down. Mateo: No offense, but you\\'re my competition, so I\\'m kind of actually rooting for you to fail. Okay, thanks. Bye. Jonah: Hey! I figured it out. Amy: We need new shelf flags for the end caps, but we should check the DCPs first, because last time. What is happening? Glenn: Could it be a race riot? It\\'s so hard to tell in the early stages. Could be the rapture, but then why am I still here? Jonah: Hey. I am killing it over here. Amy: You\\'re only discounting everything 25%, right? Jonah: Yeah, \"scan, \"reassign,\" \"yes,\" \"override,\" \"yes,\" \"reprice\". Amy: Reduce. Jonah: Huh? Amy: Reduce 0.25. Reprice 0.25? That would change everything to 25¢. Shut it down! Shut it all down! Cheyenne: If you sign up for our Heavenly Shoppers program today, you\\'ll save 15% off your purchase, which would drop your price to 22¢. Amy: Stop selling everything! Shut it down! Shut it all down! Sir, you need to stay right there. Frank, nobody leaves! Ma\\'am! Ma\\'am, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m gonna need to recheck some of these items. SoccerMom: No thank you, buh-bye. Amy: I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t just let you leave with a whole basket full of 25¢ tech, oww! SoccerMom: I have more where that came from, lady! Amy: Oh, I don\\'t think so! Garrett: Attention, shoppers. Due to an employee error, very expensive electronics are pricing out at 25¢. This mistake is being corrected, so stock up quick! Go, go, go, go! Jonah: What I\\'m trying to say is, this is not 25¢. Sir, no. No two-five, no. SoccerMom: It touched my car; it\\'s mine! Amy: That\\'s not a thing. SoccerMom: It is a thing. Mateo: I don\\'t want to be \"that guy,\" but if you had to compare my performance versus Jonah, uhh, okay. Garrett: Yeah, you better hurry up, girl. You better get that TV. Frank : Stop, stop! Please, I\\'m begging you! Jonah: She\\'s very, she\\'s, they\\'re very pretty, yep. Amy: Ow! Frank! Frank: Y\\'all don\\'t want to do this. Please! Dina: Sale\\'s over!  Glenn: There\\'s no need to identify whoever it is whose fault this was. We can all learn a lesson here. Mateo: Would that lesson be not letting Jonah reprice inventory in the future? Glenn: It might be, yes. All right. Punctuality. I do not tolerate it, because I do not tolerate it in myself. I am an angry man, so I get places early... Jonah: Hey do they allow employees to date supervisors? Garrett: I don\\'t know. Why? Jonah: Just curious. Glenn: Let\\'s always remember, the customer is always right.  Jonah: Hey, what\\'s-your-name, check it out. Amy: Ah. I was wondering what was taking so long to stack a few cans. Jonah: I just I wanted to reiterate how sorry I am about before. Amy: And when a customer wants a can of ginger root beer and the whole thing collapses on top of them, how are you gonna feel then? Jonah: I was just trying to have some fun. Amy: This might be a cultural thing, but around here, the less screwing everything up you do, the better. Jonah: You talking about the cans or the pricing thing? Amy: You see, the fact that it\\'s your first day and there\\'s already more than one option of things you screwed up is not a good thing. Jonah: Okay, I\\'ve made some mistakes. I can admit that, but that doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t have a little fun at work, does it? Or try and find some moments of beauty in the everyday? Amy: Wait, I\\'m sorry. Did you really just use the phrase \"moments of beauty,\" like, conversationally? Jonah: Okay, yes, that\\'s cheesy, but do you remember \"American Beauty\"? Even a plastic bag can be breathtaking. Amy: Wow. That really blew my mind. Like, boom, I have goose bumps. Jonah: I felt something. I\\'m Jonah. It\\'s my first day.  Cheyenne: Okay. Stay still. Dina: I don\\'t usually wear eyeliner. Sharpie occasionally, but... Cheyenne: So tell me about this special guy. Dina: Okay. Male, Caucasian, no discernible scars or tattoos. Cheyenne: Sounds dreamy. Dina: Yeah. Cheyenne: You know, speaking of boys, I\\'ve got a pretty big decision to make. My boyfriend, he... Dina: I\\'m glad we could bond like this. Thank you. Mateo: Excuse me, excuse me! Hi! I hung up everything that was in the dressing rooms, and I organized it by style, color, size, and relevance of designer. Amy: Wow. Good job. Mateo: I enjoy hard work. It\\'s just like my mom always said: \"If you don\\'t work hard, Baby Jesus will cry.\" Amy: Okay. Mateo: I don\\'t think I could be happy fooling around in the parking lot like the other new guy.  Jonah: Slow down! This is not fair! You have more experience on wheels than I do! Garrett: Your disability is not my concern! Amy: Seriously? The only thing I asked you to do was put the carts away. Jonah: That\\'s what I\\'m doing, just somewhat circuitously. Garrett: See you later, sucka! Amy: Are you trying to get fired? What if Glenn sees this? Glenn: Coming through! Move! Jonah: That doesn\\'t count. Glenn: Go, Glenn! Yeah! Yeah! Yes! In your faces! Your faces! Ha-ha! Amy: Okay. I get it. You\\'re the fun guy. I\\'m the stick in the mud. Well, I could be fun. I could have fun. Let\\'s have fun. Jonah: Of course you can have fun. Amy: Whoo! We\\'re playing at work. Jonah: No brakes! I have no brakes! No ooh!  Amy: Peace offering. Jonah: Are those the flowers that I picked up off the floor of the garden center? Amy: Yes. Jonah: They\\'re beautiful trash flowers. Amy: Look, I\\'m sorry, okay? I have been having a long day. Ten years of long days, actually. You know, I stock these glow stars every single year for the back-to-school sale. And then I take them down, and I put up the Halloween inventory, and then Thanksgiving and Christmas and Valentine\\'s Day and Easter and Fourth of July, and then back-to-school again. Jonah: Hmm. That sounds incredibly not fun. I see why you love it here. Amy: It\\'s a good job. But tomorrow is gonna be just like today, and I know that because today is just like yesterday. So sometimes it\\'s just kind of hard to find those moments of beauty.  Garrett: Attention, shoppers. Even a big box store has to close, and it\\'s about that time. You know, when Pandora closed her famous box, there was only one thing left inside - hope. I wonder what will be left inside of this box. Could it be Grace? I hope not. If you\\'re Grace\\'s parents, please pick her up at customer service.  Mateo: I took the initiative upon myself to reorganize the toy section for the convenience of adult shoppers. It was just feeling overly whimsical. Jonah: I want to show you something I\\'ve been working on. Mateo: Oh. You were working. Where? Because I\\'ve been in every single department, and I haven\\'t seen you in a couple hours, unless you were in, like, the break room maybe. Bo: Everybody get down on the ground, now! Get down, get down, get down! Touch the ground! Or get out! All right, calm down. Do what I say, and nobody gets hurt. Dina: This is what I trained for. Bo: Now, I\\'m gonna start killing somebody every minute, unless unless you agree to marry me, Cheyenne. Hit it! Garrett: Hey, what the... Bo: I\\'ll say, \"Will you marry me?\" Jonah: I had nothing to do with this. Amy: Yeah, I know. This is the fault of YouTube. Bo: Heard you want to walk down the aisle. Your baby needs a daddy, we\\'ve been bangin\\' for a while. All right, I pay the consequences of my actions. Don\\'t try to change me \\'cause I\\'m a man of action. Glenn: Yo! What a show. Dina: I\\'m calling to report a code green in progress. I repeat, code green. Operator: What\\'s a code green? Dina: I faxed you a list of codes last month! Hostage situation! You need to get SWAT down here right now! Bo: When all these people gonna learn? We\\'re gonna get burned, just waiting for our turn. Yo, #BlackLivesMatter, y\\'all. Okay, if you like what you heard and saw, I\\'m currently seeking representation in all areas. Also, I do modeling, so I\\'m just throwing that out there. All right, peace out, St. Louis. Cheyenne: Bo! Bo: What? Oh, my bad, yo. Cheyenne Tyler Lee, will you marry me? Or are you gonna be, like, a dick about it? Dina: Oh, I think he\\'s about to shoot a hostage. I\\'ll do what I can. Operator: Don\\'t do anything. Amy: What is this? Jonah: Moment of beauty?  Garrett: To Cheyenne. All: Cheers! Garrett: May your marriage be as sweet and colorful as this Cloud 9 brand caffeinated malt beverage, without the recall for killing college students. Cheyenne: Thank you, on behalf of myself and Bo. Amy: Well, he did make it memorable. I\\'ll give him that. Jonah: I mean, most guys don\\'t even bother threatening to kill you when they propose. Dina: You were never in any real danger. You know that, right? Jonah: Yeah, I know. It was a fake robbery. Dina: This is a high-velocity 440-grain lead flat-nose projectile with gas checks and a boxer-primed brass jacket. If he\\'d come within 10 feet of you, you would have seen his head explode like a watermelon. Cleanup on aisle I don\\'t even know what aisle it is, \\'cause his brains would be splattered all over the sign. Oh, shoot. Cheyenne: You know, I wish that we could wear jewelry at work. Amy: Oh, it\\'s so sparkly. Cheyenne: You know, I thought about what you said about not doing something that I might regret, but then, in the moment, you know, under the stars, it just felt right. Without you, I would have never said yes, so thank you. Jonah: Oh. Cheyenne: Well, I should go bail out my boyfriend now. Or I mean bail out my fiancé! Glenn: Aw. Amy: All right. I got to get going. Good night, everyone. All: Good night. Jonah: Hey, wait up. Wait up. Hey, I didn\\'t mean to... that, in there... I just wanted today to feel different than yesterday. Amy: Well, then you completely failed, because that exact same thing happened yesterday. But thank you. Jonah: Okay. Amy: I really do have to get going. See you at work tomorrow, Jonah? Jonah: You certainly will champ. Amy: Amy. Jonah: Nice to meet you, Amy. Garrett: Yo, you should come with us, man. We\\'re gonna throw some mannequin limbs in the dumpster and watch garbage men freak out. Jonah: That sounds awesome. Garrett: It is awesome. Come on. ']"

    "1. Veep is the most negative show compared to all the others here. Surprisingly, The Office and Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia (IASIP) are the most positive ones, even though these shows do not involve particularly cheerful characters or themes. Looks like they tried to stay positive at least in the pilot episode! \n",
    "2. Notably, none of the shows exhibit negativity < 0. This makes sense because they are comedies, so its unlikely for circumstances to get dark enough for considerable negativity. \n",
    "3. There are some shows that exhibit similar levels of positivity- Superstore and The Mindy Project (TMP) are almost equally positive, as are Brooklyn Nine Nine and IASIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subjectivity (measured along Y-axis; range: 0 to 1)\n",
    "1. The characters in The Mindy Project (TMP) primarily express themselves via opinions instead of facts (as a viewer, can confirm :)). Next in line in this regard are Veep and IASIP (again, as a viewer, can confirm).\n",
    "2. Almost all the other shows tend toward fact-based expression. Silicon Valley seems to have the most fact-based narrative style (the characters are often describing how a product works or who owns which company, which falls in the facts territory).\n",
    "3. Parks and Recreation, Scrubs and 30 Rock exhibit very similar levels of facts. That's an interesting insight because all three are based on wildly different environments (a government office, a hospital, and an improv show, respectively). Based on my preferences, it looks like I enjoy shows where the characters have a relatively fact-based manner of speaking. Shows taht are too fact-based or too-opinion based may not be likable for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall\n",
    "1. All shows exhibit small levels of positivity (0.01 to 0.18), in a range between 0 to 1. This means that even though they are comedies, they dont have wildly cheerful dialogue. This makes sense because its a 'workplace comedy' genre, where there's a healthy mix of clashes with authority, interactions with customers/clients/patients/citizens, and interpersonal conflict (unlike a full-blown comedy show like FRIENDS where most average interactions have scope for positivity and humour).\n",
    "2. Veep, TMP, and IASIP are unique shows (amongst the other shows and with respect to each other). If someone wants an introduction to this genre of TV, they shouldnt start with any of these.\n",
    "3. Superstore isnt particularly unique in terms of either polarity or subjectivity, which means further analysis is required or different metrics need to be considered."

    "The polarity over time for each script tells an interesting story\n",
    "1. Brooklyn Nine Nine is the most positive show. It steers clear from negativity by a considerable margin compared to other shows.\n",
    "2. The Mindy Project and Scrubs go below the line in terms of negativity (this makes sense because they are medical shows and it may involve concepts of emergency care/illness etc.) 30 Rock shouldnt go so low, but it does. Thats a little odd. \n",
    "3. Surprisingly, Veep is extremely negative- the entire 2nd half of the script involves negativity. This is sad (no pun intended) for a show that is primarily a comedy. Those who enjoy upbeat and lowstakes shows may not enjoy it.\n",
    "4. I wanted to check if Superstore does anything differently compared to the other shows, because it was the latest of all these shows (pilot developed in 2015-16) and has one of the most self-contained and fantastic pilot episodes. It appears that Superstore achieves the highest level of positivity at one point (compared to all other shows), maybe this is a defining factor: a high peak followed by some shenanigans involving more ups and downs tells a more compelling story.
