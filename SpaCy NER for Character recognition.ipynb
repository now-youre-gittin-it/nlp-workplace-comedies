       "'J.D (V.0.) Since I was eleven years old, I\\'ve been able to sleep through anything. Storms, earthquakes, my girlfriend yelling at me to \"Open the door or we\\'re through, you name it.  J.D (V.0.) Last night I didn\\'t sleep.  I guess I get a little goofy when I\\'m nervous. You see, today isn\\'t just any other day.. It\\'s my first day. I\\'m the man. J.D (V.0.) And four years of pre-med, four years of med school, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid loans have finally made me realize one important thing... .. NURSE KEARNEY Good, could you go drop aN.G. tube on the patient in 234 and call the attending if the lavage is positive? J.D. Sure. J.D (V.O.) I don\\'t know jack. So, this is my story... J.D I\\'m supposed to be up in intensive care- NURSE KEARNEY Good. We just turfed him there. We transferred him to I.C.U. J.D. Was this before you turfed him? NURSE KEARNEY That\\'s what turfing means. J.D. I know that. I\\'m just having some fun with you. Woo-hoo...  J.D (V.0.) Look, I got into medicine because I always wanted to help people, but orientation yesterday didn\\'t really focus on patient care... LAWYER The hospital doesn\\'t want to be sued, you don\\'t want to. be sued - let\\'s be honest, no one likes being sued. Being sued is not a good thing... J.D. Turk, You know how I\\'m totally down with the rap music... TURK Dude, be whiter. J.D (V.0.) * Chris Turk is my best friend. We * roomed together in college. * We roomed together in med school. * * J.D (V.0.) * Hell, we even got accepted by the * same hospital. * J.D. Here\\'s the thing. Tupac, DMX, Dr. Dre- in most of their songs, these artists use an extremely volatile word-- TURK Nigger. Yes, I am aware of that.  J.D. My question is this. If we\\'re both singing aiong, and knowing that otherwise I\\'d never use the word, am I allowed to say-- TURK No. J.D. But what if- TURK Nooo. J.D. See, that\\'s good to know. LAWYER Finally Doctors, if you make a mistake, call me. Please, don\\'t admit it to the patient, or the patient\\'s family especially if there is a death involved. Of course; if the patient is deceased, you can feel free to tell him or her anything. J.D. So, hey, I found us an apartment - DR. KELSO Listen up gang, I\\'m Dr. Bob Kelso, and I\\'m your chief of medicine. We\\'ve got some exciting times ahead, gang, so I want you to think of me as your safety net, because I promise you, we are a family likehere. Now, I bought pizza in case you\\'d to stick around and touch base with your fellow interns. Go get \\'em, doctors. J.D. Can I sing black magic woman?  TURK You can hum it.  So the surgical interns are gonna go grab a beer. J.D. The medical interns are having a Pac-Man tournament. Apparently we\\'re all twelve. ELLIOT (0.S.) I love Pac-Man. J.D. Me too. I love playing it, I love watching it played. I just love it. ELLIOT I\\'m Elliot. TURK ELLIOT Yeah, don\\'t do that. J.D. I\\'m J.D., this is Turk. TURK So, Elliot... you medical or surgery? ELLIOT Medical. AS TURK REACTS and WE HEAR A PAC-MAN DIE: ELLIOT So every male in my family is a doctor. My dad, my granddad, my brother. Guess that\\'s why Dad gave me a guy\\'s name, made me play sports, date girls, I\\'m joking.  J.D. I know, I would\\'ve laughed if you had paused. ELLIOT Good. It was funny. So, Turk\\'s cute. J.D (V.0.) If she likes Turk, so be it. J.D. He\\'s getting married. ELLIOT Anyway, I got better board scores than Gramps, my dad, and my stupid brother...I know what you\\'re thinking. J.D (V.O.) Your butt looks like two pringles next to each other. J.D: No you don\\'t.  ELLIOT The whole Miss having-to-be-the-best thing, \"Hyper competitive, I mean it used to be a big problem for me, used to... past  tense. J.D. Hey. Are we racing?  ELLIOT Yes.  ELLIOT So, you do a lot of cardio?  JEFFERY Reid and John Dorian?  Great. One, I am your resident, Dr. Jeffery Steadman, not Jeff. Two, here are your Manuals... These can answer any basic questions you have so don\\'t bother me, ever, Kay? Three, don\\'t be a moron and open your manual in up front of a patient, Four... J.D. (V.O.) You ever notice how quickly some people make an impression? JEFFERY. I\\'m a tool, I\\'m a tool. I\\'m a tool, tool, * tool, tool, unbelievably annoying tool. * J.D. Yeah. JEFFERY Finally, these are your beepers. From now on, these control your life, kay? J.D. Sorry, gotta go. J.D. I was beeped... CARLA Aww, first day Bambi? Carla will take care of you - don\\'t look at me when we\\'re moving someone. CARLA We\\'re waiting for Dr. Cox... J.D. Hi, Dr., I\\'m-- DR. COX Place an I.V. for me. J.D. We\\'ll talk later. DR. COX Carla, a personal question. Do you spray your perfume on or do you keep a tub full of the crap and slosh around in it? CARLA I smell nice.  J.D (V.O.) C\\'mon, you\\'ve done this to cadavers before. So this guy\\'s alive, just poke it through his skin, poke it through - Now!  DR. COX Time\\'s up. Do that for him, please. I\\'m also gonna need to get an ABG. J.D. Why are you telling her? DR. COX Shut up and watch. CARLA Awwww, be nice to Bambi. DR. COX This gomer has got to stop trying to die while I\\'m eating lunch. J.D..  That\\'s a little insensitive.  J.D (V.0.) Mistake. DR. COX This man is ninety-two, and has full dementia. He doesn\\'t even know we\\'re here. For Christ sake, he\\'s inches away from Carla\\'s rack and he hasn\\'t even flinched. That\\'s so sweet. J.D. What about his subconscious? DR. COX  Eisenhower was a sissy. By the grace of God, I think we\\'re gonna be okay. From now on, when I\\'m in the room, you\\'re not allowed to talk. DR. KELSO Now, Mr. Dorian, can you tell me what ailment... J.D (V.0.) I\\'m gonna love rounds. The constant questions, it\\'s like being on a gameshow.  J.D. What is uremia? DR. KELSO That\\'s my boy. J.D. Uremia may lead to a symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy that tends to affect the lower limbs more than upper limbs, and is more marked aistally than proximally... DR. KELSO Whoa, sport. Who stuck a quarter in you? Nice, clean job with the foley catheter. I J.D (V.O.) had a nurse do it. J.D. Thank you, sir. J.D (V.0.) Unfortunately, I\\'m still afraid to touch anybody. I\\'d been thinking a lot about Elliot. She\\'s an anal-retentive, crazy, smartypants, but in kind of a sexy way, you know? DR. KELSO Dr. Reid, you\\'re late. ELLIOT I got puked on, and seeing as it was already the fifth time today, I needed to cry for a few minutes. DR. KELSO Nothing wrong with squirting out a few. You\\'re off the hook if you can tell me what to look out for in a uremic patient.  J.D (V.0.) Anyway, I decided to go for it. J.D. Infection. ELLIOT Infection? DR. KELSO That\\'s my girl. Moving on... ELLIOT I knew the answer. J.D. I\\'m sure you did. ELLIOT I was just frazzled-- J.D. How could you net be? ELLIOT You know, with the-- J.D. know. ELLIOT Good. But thanks, if I can ever do anything for you-- J.D. You could let your hair down again. ELLIOT Can I wash the puke out first? J.D. If you want. ELLIOT We\\'ll see. BOY. Daddy, why did you marry Mommy? J.D. Well Tiger, I gave her an answer during rounds and she immediately had sex with me.  ELLIOT (with sitcom smile) Now go do your homework so I can continue to satisfy your father sexually while never questioning his authority.  DR. COX What the hell are you doing?  DR. COX Did you actually page me to ask how much tylenol to give Mrs. Lenzer? J.D. I was worried that it could exacerbate the patient\\'s DR. COX It\\'s regular strength tylenol! Have her open her mouth, throw a handful at her, and whatever lands in there is the correct dosage. J.D. But--  DR. COX And by no means are you to compromise our no talking agreement. J.D. Dr. Cox, if you could give me any advice-- JDR. COX Try not to kill anyone. J.D. Uh-huh. Dr. Kelso tells us all to stay positive. DR. COX Look, I\\'m going to be careful because I don\\'t want to overstate this: Dr. Kelso is the most evil human being on the face of the earth and may actually be the devil himself. J.D. Super. It\\'s just that this isn\\'t what I expected.Labs and tests  and charts - it\\'s all scut work. Plus most of my patients are... Older and kind of checked out mentally... DR. COX Pumpkin, that\\'s modern medicine. Bureaucratic nightmares, paperwork out the ass, and advances that keep people who should have died years ago alive, when they lost what made them people. Your  job is to stay sane enough so that when someone comes in that you can actually help,  you\\'re not too braindead to function, what!?! J.D. Do you think we should talk about this in front of-- DR. COX Her? She\\'s dead. Write this down, Newbie. You push around a stiff, nobody asks to you do anything. J.D. Thanks, you\\'ve been like a father to me. DR. COX Fine, you want some real advice? They find out that you\\'re making nurses do all your procedures they\\'ll throw you out on your ass so quick it\\'ll make you dizzy. J.D (V.0.) And there it is. DR. COX Have a terrific day.  OLD WOMAN Stop staring at me. CARLA Okay Bambi, here\\'s Mrs. Lenzer\\'s tox screen, Mr. Hobert\\'s blood work... J.D (V.0.) I couldn\\'t help wondering if Turk is having the same experience I am. TURK I\\'m such a stud. J.D (V.O.) Probably not. TURK This morning, I had my hands inside a guy\\'s chest. All the way inside; I couldn\\'t even see them.. I shouldn\\'t be allowed to do that. J.D. And you weren\\'t scared? TURK What\\'s there to be scared of? You know what the attending said: \"One way or another, everyone stops bleeding\". That\\'s deep man. CARLA No. it\\'s not. TURK It\\'s a little deep. J.D. So, hey, we never finished before. I have to tell you about our apartment-  TODD T-man! TURK J.D., Todd. J.D. Hey, how\\'re you do-- J.D. Can I talk to you?  And like that, I was back in high school. You see, surgical interns, they\\'re all slice \\'em and dice \\'em. They\\'re the Medical interns jocks. - we\\'re trained to think about the body. Diagnose, test, keep everything on a little notecard. The medical interns, well... TODD You\\'ve got a stain. J.D (V.0.) We\\'re the chess club. J.D. I\\'m waiting for someone. JANITOR Door\\'s broke. Every fifth time or so it don\\'t open. J.D. Maybe there\\'s a penny stuck in there. JANITOR Why a penny? J.D. I don\\'t know... JANITOR Did you stick a penny in there? J.D. I was just making small talk. JANITOR If I find a penny, I\\'m taking you down. ELLIOT Oh my God being on call sucks. You\\'re all alone, all night - it\\'s terrifying, you know? J.D. The janitor wants to kill me. ELLIOT Anyway, about eleven hours into being on call last night, my twentieth admission was this young girl who was throwing up blood, and.. I actually wished it was me. J.D. You know, I\\'ll bet he\\'s killed before. ELLIOT Seriously, I\\'d gladly be that sick to lie in  bed, watch TV, get to eat hospital pudding, right? Right? J.D. Yeah, yeah, yeah, blood for pudding. You. know, we\\'re both off Monday night, so maybe, you know, if you\\'re not. busy, I don\\'t know, maybe we could--. ELLIOT I like Italian food, the movie we\\'re seeing starts  at 9, so we\\'ll eat at 7:30, and please don\\'t wear those shoes.  J.D (V.0.} See? She just gets me. DR. KELSO Welcome to rounds, kids. Patient number one... J.D (V. 0.) Bottom line, Elliot is the girl of my dreams. DR. KELSO ..the necrosis, and infected stool most likely indicate what, Dr. Dorian? ELLIOT I don\\'t know.(whispers) Sir... J.D. I have no idea. DR. KELSO Well, I\\'m very disappointed in you, son. Dr. Reid, can you help him out? * ELLIOT I\\'d say it\\'s superior mesenteric insufficiency. DR. KELSO That\\'s my girl. Patient number two... J.D (V.0.) The only way to bounce back is to stay positive. J.D. Ms. Pratt,(cheery)I\\'m here to remove some of that fluid from your belly, relieve a little of that tightness. MS. PRATT Shut up and do it. J.D. Fantastic.  Ma\\'am, I\\'m going to need you to roll over for just a second. TURK (0.S.) Nice. J.D. You can roll back, ma\\'am. Now this\\'ll just take a second... J.D (V.O.) C\\'mon. Not in front of Turk. Just jam the razor sharp needle into her gut.  J.D. I think this needle is too big. I\\'m gonna get a nurse. TURK Learn by doing, man. Learn by doing.  J.D (V.0.) I hated him at that moment. For being able to do that, for being happy...  TURK Maybe it was too big a needle. J.D. You think? How do I seal this up? TURK You want my gum? - MS. PRATT  What\\'s going on down there? TURK This is totally normal, ma\\'am. Just have to put some pressure on it.  J.D. So, you going to move your stuff in tonight? TURK That\\'s why I came by. I just feel like we\\'ve done that already, you know? TURK It might be little... good for us to branch out a What do you think? J.D (V.0.) Tell him you miss him. Tell him you need him to look into your eyes and say that everything\\'s going to be fine just like he did when Tell him the cop pulled you over. J.D. Yeah, I feel the same way. MR. BURSKI I just have bad gas. What\\'re you testing me for? J.D. We need to know if your gas could be harmful to others. J.D. Look, Mr. Burski, I heard a systolic murmur in your heart, which is most likely nothing, but if you don\\'t let me check it out I\\'m gonna worry about you all day. MR. BURSKI Seriously? J.D. Yeah, it would drive me crazy. MR. BURSKI Then I\\'ll do it. For you. So what\\'s it like being a young hotshot doctor? J.D. Did you ever go to see a movie that everyone told you was great, then because of all those expectations, you ended up totally disappointed? MR. BURSKI Movies nowadays have too many special effects.  J.D. Yeah, that was pretty much my point. MR. BURSKI Kid,you want to know my philosophy of life?  It might help. J.D. Lay it on me, Mr. Burski. MR. BURSKI The hell with everything. J.D. I like that. J.D (V.0.) My first code. See, here\\'s how it works. Someone\\'s heart fails , they beep in the first doctor who has to run in and tell everyone in the room what to do, basically decide the patient lives or dies... What, am I crazy? J.D. You chicken. ELLIOT Me? Look at you. J.D (V.O.) Don\\'t worry about the patient. Turk was already there \"learning by doing\". TODD Fire up the juice, baby. TURK Clear.  J.D (V.O.) Plus it turns out the guy was just slightly anesthetized attached to a faulty monitor.  J.D. I thought, I don\\'t know, maybe we cared about each other. ELLIOT Oh please, if you didn\\'t want to sleep with me you would\\'ve done the same thing. J.D. I didn\\'t want to sleep with you. ELLIOT Uh-huh. And Turk\\'s getting married? J.D. Yes, he is... eventually: I\\'ll tell you one thing. There\\'s nothing in the world that would make me sleep with you now. ELLIOT Do me right here. J.D. Okay. ELLIOT See? J.D. Damn.  DR. COX Right. Hand me a trach kit, please?  ELLIOT Great. J.D. Our date is totally canceled.J.D (V.O.) I was sitting on the floor for two reasons. One, I tried to lock Elliot in that supply closet and she kicked me. Hard. And two, the on-call room was locked. J.D. C\\'mon, I\\'ve got like ten minutes to sleep.  TURK Tell me if I\\'m going too fast. CARLA Lose the clothes.  J.D (V.0.) I heard that Turk was going to move in with Todd. I\\'m surprised that high-fiving freak isn\\'t in there with him. TODD Look at you, T-man! You\\'re on fire! CARLA Nice. TURK Your turn. CARLA Nah, I\\'ve gotta get back. But very nice. TURK I\\'m off Friday, you feel like making me dinner? CARLA Que me estas Biciendo? TURK Or I could take you out. Your call. CARLA Date a surgeon? With the God complex and the married-to-the-work?  Hey Bambi. TURK You coming in? J.D. Thought I might wait for you not be naked.  J.D. You look adorable. MR. BURSKI Ah, the hell with everything. J.D. Hey, I got your test results. You\\'re gonna be fine. One more night and you\\'re out of here.  MR. BURSKI Thank you. Thank you so much. J.D. No problem. PATIENT (0.S.) Nurse... Nursey... Cutie pie... ELLIOT I\\'m a doctor, okay. The white coat, the stethoscope - a doctor, got it? CARLA Relax. ELLIOT I just hate it. I hate the \"darlin\\'s\", I hate the \"sweethearts\"... CARLA You don\\'t need to tell me how hard it is being a woman around here. ELLIOT Well, you\\'re certainly furthering the cause by wearing a thong to work and hooking up in the on-call room.  ELLIOT (CONT\\'D) Word gets around. CARLA You talk like that, do you even know my name? I\\'m 34, I spend every second of my life either here, or taking care of my mom, so yeah, maybe I needed a little closeness. I\\'m sure you never had a quickie at the club, or snuck some skinny, flat-butted, college boy up to your sorority room, and judge me? And my thong - I like to think it makes my ass look good, and some days I need to feel good about something around here, and you judge me? Well, guess what. Word does get around, Ms. \"Out for herself\", so you can dump on everyone here if you want, but you will not hurt me. You will not hurt me... J.D. Look at you making new friends.  J.D, I couldn\\'t get any sleep \\'cause Turk practically had sex in the on-call room. DR. COX You are aware that I have no idea who Turk is, but good for him. \\'Cause Billy, sex is life-affirming. Now, how bout you give me a urine sample, captain. BILLY But I just did five minutes ago. DR. COX Tell you what. This time put the cup on the ground and just go nuts.  J.D, Seems like a good kid. DR. COX Yeah. Why are you here? J.D (V.0.) I\\'m worried about being on-call tonight. DR. COX You\\'re worried about being on call tonight. J.D. No. J.D (V.0.) I don\\'t think I can handle it. DR. COX You don\\'t think you can handle it, do you? J.D (V.O.) Stop doing that. DR. COX Look, worst case scenario, you kill someone and it hangs over your head your whole life, but that\\'s absolute worst case. Jeez, Newbie, just use the nurses for all the stuff you\\'re still too chicken to do, which is, if I\\'m guessing, everything. And there\\'s a really tough admission-- J.D. Call you? DR. COX God, no. I was going to say you can hide in the closet again.  BILLY That was mean. DR. COX Yeah, maybe... You forgive me, pal? BILLY I will if you talk about sex some more. DR. COX Boobies. DR. KELSO Hey champ. First night on call starts soon, huh? Gosh, you must be excited. J.D. You betcha. DR. KELSO Oh, About Mrs. Pratt - I heard that you want to put her on the hospital\\'s transplant list. Just thought I\\'d recommend sticking with dialysis a while longer. Maybe we\\'ll get lucky. J.D. No problem. DR. KELSO Great. Have a ball, on-call. Little poem for ya. J.D. I\\'ll check on-you every ten minutes, okay, Mrs. Marino? NURSE ROBERTS * I need you in Mr. Burski\\'s room. J.D. Are you flirting with me? NURSE ROBERTS * He crashed while you were admitting in the E.R. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism, no way anyone could\\'ve it. Anyway, you have to pronounce J.D. But the tests said he was fine.  -NURSE ROBERTS Could you just pronounce him so I can go home? J.D (V.0.) I\\'ll never forget that moment. The moonlight on his face. The stillness. The shame that all I could think about * was how hard this was for me. J.D. Time of death 0200. J.D (V.0.) The hell with everything. PIZZA GUY What happened? J.D. You were delivering a pizza to the emergency room, and apparently our sliding glass door malfunctioned, and you just ran right into the glass. You\\'re going to be fine, but you gave yourself a good concussion, so you might have a little short term memory loss, maybe some nausea. PIZZA GUY What happened? J.D (V.0.) Oh, make it stop. TURK (0.S.) Man, I lied before, I\\'m scared every second. Really? TURK Jeez, J.D., all the blood. Thank God for the surgical mask, man, \\'cause without it everyone would know that I look like this whole time. J.D. I think it\\'s okay to be scared. TURK Yeah? I really need you to tell me stuff like that once in a while... J.D (V.0.) He needs me?  TURK Anyway, I just wanted to check on you. J.D (V.0O.) Just say it. J.D. You know the offer still stands if want to you move in with-- TURK Already took the keys from your bag.  PIZZA GUY What happened? J.D. I\\'ll tell you later. J.D (V.0.) And like that, I got a second wind.  ELLIOT Are you telling everyone that I screwed you over at rounds? J.D. Not everyone. Only the people that work here. Oh, and my parents.  DR. KELSO Morning. How\\'re you holding up? J.D (V.0.) Ahh, there he is. My safety net. DR. KELSO I saw that you\\'re still pushing for putting Mrs. Pratt on the transplant list. Bad news though, sport, she doesn\\'t have the insurance to cover it-- J.D. Yeah, but the lady\\'s a second away from total renal failure-- DR. KELSO Uh-huh, Okay. Did you ask the Burski family for permission to do an autopsy? J.D. They\\'re still in there with him... DR. KELSO This is a teaching hospital, son. Gotta ask. J.D (V.O.) Just tell him how you\\'ll ask every time from now on, but you can\\'t face those people again. He\\'ll understand. J.D, Sir, do you think I could just skip this one? DR. KELSO Sure, sport. J.D (V.0.) See? Every story needs a good guy. DR. KELSO In fact, why don\\'t you just head home, you look tired. g.D. I am pretty tired. DR. KELSO Mr. Dorian, do you not realize that you\\'re nothing but a couple of large pairs of surgical scrubs to me? For God\\'s sake, the reason I carry this chart around is so I can pretend to remember all your damn names. Now, if the patient has insurance, treat them, if not, show them the door. And if someone dies, you get the autopsy. You get it by rounds tomorrow, or I\\'ll be crossing your name Off my chart, are we clear...? Answer me.  J.D. Crystal clear, sir. DR. KELSO Great, sport.  J.D (V.O.) I don\\'t get it. If he\\'s a jerk, then who\\'s the good guy? CARLA Car accident, he was stable in the E.R., went into arrest about twenty seconds ago.  DR. COX We need to relieve the pressure in the chest. J.D., do it. J.D (V.O.) Oh, God, no. DR. COX Look at me. You can do this. J.D (V.O.) And I believed him... J.D. tray. J.D (V.O.) Kinda. Oh man, oh man, oh man-- J.D. I can\\'t pop it through the pleura. DR. COX Don\\'t be gentle, c\\'mon now...  J.D. Connect it, please Carla. CARLA Normal rhythm. J.D. No way. DR. COX See?

PETE So would he join the cast...? s JACK Join the cast, permanent guest host Im going to meet with him this afternoon and see what he thinks JACK What are you doing? LISA Sometimes when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it. LISA This is not a dream. JACK Jonathan, take Pete and help him pick out a Trivection oven for his wife. PETE Hey. LISA Wait. LISA We also want a coffee machine, a snack basket JACK Done. Jonathan?

As a rule, if you see a celebrity when youre with the tour group, do not bother them. KENNETH Is that a quideline, or a rule? Cause I respond well to structure. PETE Lets say its a rule. LISA Hey. JENNA Hey. What happened to your head? LISA The sky is falling. Do you have a minute? JENNA No. I have a costume fitting for the Judgemental Baby sketch. LISA Ahh. I11 find you after.

LISA Would you like me to review for you everything youve done wrong so far? Youve hired a guy so crazy that nobody else in the world will work with him right now. You brought him in here without even talking to Jenna first, which will send her into a twoyear spiral. Youre putting him in my hands, knowing I dont want him here. You gave my greedy, insatiable writing staff every toy they asked for, which only means they will have a longer list of things they want tomorrow. Dont stop feeding those deer, Mr. Donaghy, or they will turn on you. JACK Youll make it work. LISA What makes you think that? JACK Cause your friend Jennas got nowhere else to go. Youll be nice to Lawrence, cause its not his fault. And youll focus all your rage and hatred on me. LISA Ugh, you know what? You dont know everything about me. JACK About 127 pounds.

They had it at my uncles funeral. I gorged myself at that funeral. I mean, I was constipated for three days. JAKE: Wow, thats a great story, Charles, thank you. All right, listen up, everybody.

Ill pick a better movie than Citizen Kane. HOLT: So Gina. Civilian administrators like yourself often have their ear to the ground. What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs? GINA: I will tell you on six conditions. Number one, you let me use your office to practice my dance moves. Second HOLT: How about this? If you tell me GINA: Mmhmm. HOLT: I wont have you suspended without pay. GINA: Oh, that sounds great. Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car. Its an old Mustang, and its pretty sweet. If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him. He guarantees it will end in sex. I bet on at least some overtheclothes action. At the very least, some touching HOLT: No, thats enough, Gina. GINA: Caresses. I could see him showing up in a silk robe. HOLT: Thats enough, Gina. GINA: All right. HOLT: Thank you. JAKE: Let the wasting of time begin. AMY: Hello, sir. Can we ask you a few questions? GUY: Definitely. Yeah. Im actually Im super glad you guys are here right now. Are you smelling that weed smell? AMYJAKE: Yeah. GUY: Cause a dude broke in, smoked weed, and bolted. JAKE: Do you think its the same dude that left that bong there on the floor? GUY: Yes? Police! Hello. Hello. Whats your name? My name? Mmhmm. Mlepnos. Can you spell that, please? Mlep Clay. Did you say Clay? Yes, the Clay is silent. All right, got it. Have you seen this man before? He was shot last night. Oh. Thank you. No, sir, thats ours. We need that. We And he kept it. Wall Street journal on the doormat Top floor apartment. like a hot, eligible bachelor. Ill take that action. Police! Open up! Hello. Oh! Hello, sir! How are you today? I am Detective RightAllTheTime, and this is my partner Detective Terrible Detective. No surprises from the coroner. A few gunshots, shoulder and chest. None of the neighbors heard or saw anything. And whats worse, Santiago struck out with a 92yearold. That is not accurate, sir. Wait, you hooked up with him? Ugh! All right, hit the pawn shops and canvass the neighborhood. And while youre out, you can buy yourself a tie. Oh, actually, sir Im wearing a tie right now. Check it out. Secret tie. First of all, I think youre kind of overdoing it with the manscaping. But more importantly, Detective, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously? Does anyone here know why its so important to me that you all dress appropriately? Hmm. Four highly trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery. I wanna be briefed on any new developments. Any questions? I was gonna ask you if you thought I was doing too much manscaping, but we solved that one. So Im good. Hey, Boyle. Yep. What about this fancy ham stuff? Jamon Iberico. Yes. The perp left a really expensive TV but then stole ham? It doesnt make sense. Is there a place nearby the crime scene that sells it? Beneficios might.Lets go. You gotta brief the C. O. first. Well brief him after we catch the guy. My name is Ratko. I dont know anything. Oh, okay. You recognize this guy? Henry Morgenthau? No. Maybe actually look at the picture. I dont know him. I dont know what happened. No more questions. Well, why dont I run a scenario past you, Ratko, and you tell me what you think? You do know Morgenthau. He came in here and tried to sell you some hams. You knew they were worth a lotta money, so you tried to steal them from him when he wasnt home. Only he was home, so you shot him. Does that sound familiar? Uh, maybe some role play will jog your memory? Great idea. Okay, yeah. Okay. So Im Im Ratko. No, no, Im Ratko. Come on. Im always the victim. Look, Im doing this with you right here. Fine, fine. Oh! Im Henry Morgenthau, owner of delicious and expensive hams. Dont I know you from the grocery store? Kill! And scene. NYPD! Everyone down! Maam, if you could just get down, or ignore me and continue shopping. Boyle, get the door! On it! Ratko! Oh! Ow! Ha ha ha! Ow, Ratko, ow! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Ratko! Im getting mad! Thats a waste of manchego! Charles! How are you still here? Jake! Little help! Ratko! Hes not going anywhere, Jake! Ratko! I got him! I got him! Dont worry! So no, I did not brief you. And yes, he did get away. But some bonus good news I got you hazelnut. And A little spoon there for you. Is he seriously assigning me to the records room? I mean, why do we even have a records room? Computers been invented, right? I didnt dream it? Youre lucky, man. I wish I could get assigned here fulltime. You could not be farther from the action. Sergeant, you know me. I have more arrests than anyone. Will you please tell the Captain how dumb it is to lock his best Detective in a file cabinet? Second best. Youre wrong about Holt. That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you will ever know. In 1981, he caught the disco strangler. Its over, disco man! Put down the yoyo and back away from the girl. Wow. The man is the real deal. You need to listen to him. Gonna be hard to win our bet when youre on the bench, Peralta. Although I did start a new category. Murderers we let go. And look at that. Youre winning. Have fun with your files. Yeah, you know what, I will have fun with my files. Have fun with your face! Slam! That was a slam. So what movie did you get us tickets to? Oh, well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them. Just to be safe? What does that mean? I dont know, I didnt wanna mess up. Because youre sort of Opinionated. You think Im opinionated? Okay, heres an opinion for you. Youre a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit. So we can go see North by Northwest. Were not seeing a movie together. Good call. Smart. Keep it profesh. Hey, Captain. So you found something? Hey, I like the tie. If you cant beat em, join em. Anyway, I think I got something good here. Turns out the name Ratko is made up. But I was digging through these files One of which I literally found in a spider web And it turns out there were a bunch of references to a serbian thug, street names the rat and the butcher, whos known to hang out at a storage unit near Boerum Park, which has red soil, hence, the muddy red footprint on Morgenthaus counter. Thats fine work, Detective. Thank you very much, sir. Testament to what can be achieved when you dress appropriately. Lets pound it out. You know what, such fine police work, lets share it with the whole team. Santiago! Boyle! Diaz! Get in here! Bring everyone! And a camera! Thats not necessary. Oh, theyre here! Of the fine master Detective, Jake Peralta. Yeah, lets have a hand, everyone. Give him a hand. Yeah, nice! Looking good! Yeah. Thank you. No record of Ratko on the ledger. Mustve used cash. Well, I, for one, am just pumped to be on a stakeout with you, Captain. You know what my favorite thing about stakeouts is? Patrol guide says no dress code. So Im just the zipup hoodie and my two best friends. Does he always talk this much? I just tune it out. Its like a white noise machine. Okay, first of all, thats racist. Secondly, Captain, Terry told me you caught the disco strangler. Thats incredible. Ive read that case. With all due respect, sir, whyd it take you so long to get your first command? Because Im gay. Ah. Seriously? Im surprised you didnt know. I dont try to hide it. Did anyone else get a little bit of a gay vibe? Manscaping. Damn! I am not a good Detective. Here. I feel bad that you spent all that money on the movie tickets. Why dont you just go to the movies with me? Nope. Okay. Well, this is awkward. Its not awkward. I like your company. Youre sweet. When did you come out? About 25 years ago. The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay Detective. But then the old guard died out. Suddenly, they couldnt wait to show off the fact that they had a highly ranking gay officer. I made Captain. But they put me in a public affairs unit. I was a good soldier. I helped recruitment. But all I ever really wanted was my own command. And now I finally got it. And Im not gonna screw it up. Captain, Im sorry. I I feel like a jackass. But on the flip side, theres Ratko. Humility over. Im amazing! Fantastic. Looks like we all got door duty. Ah, yeah. From before. Good one. You look great. Clear. Clear. Okay. Unbelievable! Unbelievable! Ah. Ratko, great to see you. You cant stop me. Im going. Actually, youre not going anywhere. Cause if you take a look to your left, youll see Detectives Boyle and Diaz. Right there is Detective Santiago. And behind you is Captain Holt. Point is My team has you surrounded. Oh, my God, I just got the tie thing! Captain, I just figured it out. Maybe nows not the best time, Detective. Its a uniform! Were a team, and the tie is a part of that teams uniform, right? You ask Ratko what team? No, Ratko, shut up. Its important to you because you were kept off the team for so long. And now youre the coach, and you want us to all wear that same uniform. Boom! Nailed it! Yes, you did. Now just arrest Ratko. All right, Ratko, down. Drop the weapon. Hands on your head. Here we go. Hey! Hes running! Oh! Got him! Hands behind your back! Hands behind your back! Stay down. Thats how we do it in the ninenine, sir. Catch bad guys and look good doing it. Whats wrong with you? Never took off the speedo. Big mistake. It is inside me. Great work, team! \n",

      "Mindy: You have an idea of how your life is going to turn out. When I was a kid, all I did was watch romantic comedies in our living room while I did my homework. Ill have what shes having. Some coffee or, you know, drinks? Mindy: In High School, Tom Hanks was my first boyfriend. For as long as we both shall live. Mindy: In college, everything changed. No supervision, total freedom. I could watch romantic comedies whenever I wanted to. Im just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her. Mindy: And then two years ago, when I finally became a doctor, I had no time for any distractions. You are 8 12 months pregnant. Your husbands gotta keep his schvantz away from you. Which I can imagine must be difficult with a wife as beautiful as yours. Shes already pregnant, Dr. Reed. Idiot. I am going to put Dr. Castellano in charge. Hes my best resident. Dr. Castellano. Daniel Castellano. Im the man thats gonna take a person outta you. I dont take that responsibility lightly, okay? Shulman: Youre scaring them, Danny. Danny: Sorry. Sorry, maam. Dont be frightened. Mindy: And thats when I saw him. Oh, my God. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry. Sorry. No way. Thanks. Its happening. The doors are closing. I just love when the elevators start to do their thing. Oh. Never thought about that. I guess I do too. Oh, my God. Sorry. Oh, here, let me help you with that stuff. Sorry. Oh. Klutzes, party of two. Seriously. Mindy: Met in an elevator. My hair came undone. Are you kidding me? Im basically Sandra bullock. And then it happened. Did the elevator just stop? Im Mindy. Obstetrics and gynecology. Tom. Oral surgery. Can I get you an orange? Mindy: We were stuck in the elevator for 20 minutes... I have a sandwich here. Mindy: And I moved into his apartment two months later. What does this have to do with the circumstances of your arrest? I am getting to that. Tom got married last night to someone else. Mindy: Three months ago, he met and fell in love with some serbian girl who sells bagels in the lobby of the hospital. He fixed her teeth, dumped me, and last night, they got married. I dont think they thought I would ever go, so they invited me to be polite. But, oh, I did go. And after four vodka sodas, I realized I had something to say. Some of you might not know that Tom and I used to date. So I have some pretty good stories about everyones favorite glorified dentist. Like how Tom will always cover his ears and go, ahh, if you start talking about an episode of TV that he has not seen yet. God forbid you give away the ending to Downton abbey. What the hell is this show, and why does everybody keep talking about it? Shh. Why cant I talk? Or the time that Tom told me, um, when we were having sex that he wanted to marry me and make me pregnant with six babies. Did you guys know about that? Which I really wanted too. Hey... But that didnt end up happening cause I think I was too old. No, I mean, I know that I was too old. Thats what you said to me. Not what I said. When you broke up with me. Sorry, you said you wanted to build a future with someone with more years to share. That is what I said. Doesnt matter, because here you are, getting married to the serbian bagel girl. By the way, are we 100 sure that she is not a wr criminal? Dont look at me like that. Am I the only person here who saw Angelina jolies movie? Shes not a wr criminal. Whatever, you guys. Im so happy for you. I only want the best for the two of you. One of you. Lets wrap it up. Lchaim! Everyone, great talking to you. Huh! Great, awesome. Thank you. Brilliant. Im Sandra bullock! rcist! Ooh, a shortcut. Aah! Mindy. Mindy, down here. Ive been waiting for you. Can I tell you something, girl to girl? You are acting like a idiot. If you dont pull it together, no one will ever love you. At least I have a boyfriend. Mindy: And when that hot, mean doll pointed out that even she had a boyfriend, I just started to cry. This is not where I should be. Its important for you to know that this is not really who I am. Or who I have been is not who Im going to be. We have you down for three counts of public intoxication, theft, and disorderly conduct. Im sorry, disorderly conduct? Arent there rapists and mrder out there? When you are disorderly, you are a rpist of peace and quiet. Thats a little... okay. Shes been bailed out. Gwen, my hero. It has been great working with you and seeing this process from the inside. Before I leave, would it be possible to get a tour of the special vctim unit? No? Okay, bye. Gwen: Did you think that Tom was just gonna ditch the wedding and run off with you like youre Katherine Heigl? Kind of, yes. Well, your life is not a romantic comedy. Right now it seems more like a sad documentary about a criminally insane spinster. It kinda sounds like I could win an Oscar though. I think I should cancel that date tonight with Dennis. Gwen, no. Listen, Im just being real with you. Carl and I know, like, three datable guys that we can set friends up with, and I cant squander them on a highrisk situation like this. Okay, I promise you, Gwen, this drunk, crimecommitting person, shes history. Theres no reason for me to live my life like this. I went to a good college, I am a doctor. This is boring. My body mass index is not great, but Im not, like, precious or anything, you know? This is boring. You know what, you are boring. Contribute something. Dont call my daughter boring. Honey, youre fascinating. Hmm. Listen, Gwen, I cannot keep hooking up with Jeremy and then later asking him, hey, whats our deal anyway? That British guy, he is bad news. We do not know that he is bad news. I think he has a good heart. I think hes Hugh grant in about a boy. I think that he is Hugh grant in real life. Mindy? I hate to interrupt because I see youre enjoying some welldeserved BFF time. Hello, Gwendolyn. Hi. Your patient, Allison silverman, is going into labor. The one with insurance? Oh, hell yes, okay. Bye, guys. Gotta go. Love you. Bye, love you. Man: Hey! Its fine. Im a doctor! Medical emergency! Congratulations. There you go. Im on call. So you delivered my patient? Youre welcome. May I say you look great? Sorry, Danny, I didnt have time to get dolled up for you because I was kind of busy freeing myself from wrongful imprisonment. Wrongful? My God, you think theyll ever catch the real drunk girl who fell into the pool? Thats hilarious. But I guess its not hilarious when you get arrested for asault at a Bruce Springsteen concert. First of all, its a Springsteen show, not a Bruce Springsteen concert. You sound ignorant. Second of all, you dont show up at a Springsteen show wearing a John cougar mellencamp tshirt unless you want to get punched in the face. How did I get into this Springsteenmellencamp conversation again? Oh, and Mrs. silverman asked if Id be her doctor from now on, and I said yes. Are you kidding me? So now youre stealing my patient? Its not stealing if she wanted to go. Leave her alone, Danny. Shes had a rough night. And whose fault is that? Everyone loses it at weddings. Theyre designed to exploit our sentimental side. Thank you. I agree with that. I cant recall a wedding where I didnt end up in the arms of some woman I met that night. And not because she was vulnerable. Cause I was. You know, I used to think that sex addiction was made up by male celebrities, but now I think its real. Thats not cool. Yes, yeah, I love sex. I do it a lot. I do it well. But Im not addicted to it. Im addicted to attention. That is so interesting. Listen, Im all for lonely people making connections, but this is the doctors lounge, not the wooded area behind the highway rest stop, all right? I mean, really, guys, I hate that I cant read the newspaper in here anymore. Yeah, we get it, Danny. You read the newspaper. Youre so much smarter than us. We get it, Danny. Youre so much smarter than us. I am though. Im smarter than you. You look so trashy right now. I know. Im sorry. No, I love it. Do you wanna hang out? We are hanging out. Lets hang out deep. Oh, God. Sorry, thank you for the offer. What? I want to. You should. And I cant. Okay. Youre gorgeous. Okay, I gotta go. I gotta go. This sucks. I hate my life. Take that trashiness with you. Okay, thanks. Okay, goodbye. how am I to be with all your silly ways now note to self, try to change your life today. Im gonna take the stairs instead of taking the elevator, or escalator maybe. Baby steps. Theres a patient waiting in your office. Thats great news. Thank you, Betsy. Nasreen, you are nine months pregnant, and you dont have health insurance. Im sorry, I just... I cant take you on as a patient. But my aunt and uncle said you were the person to go to. I was. And I really, really want to help you. Its just that Im at this point in my life where I cant just do what I want to do. You know, I have to do things that really move my life forward. Like... like spinning. Do you guys know what that is? We wont tell anybody. Still, people could find out. How? Um, lets see, I talk a lot. You know, like in my sleep, on a date. I drink a lot. So I just, I cant control it. Okay, okay, okay, look, look. I will take you on as a patient, but you just need to look me in the eye and promise me that you will have health insurance by the time she delivers. But I cant promise it. I dont know if its true. It doesnt have to be true. I just need to hear it. I do this with guys all the time. I promise we will have insurance. Great, thank you. Welcome. Hey, you two, quick question. Do you care about my career and want me to succeed? More than anything in the world. Okay, well, if that is the case, why are you sending me nonenglishspeaking pregnant immigrants with no health insurance, with literally, like, burkas and stuff? I thought she might be rich with oil money. Well, she wasnt. She was poor with nothing money. Well, why wouldnt you just tell her no? Because I am not good at saying no. Okay, one time I left a flea market with a samurai sword. I just... I need a different kind of patient. More white patients, done. Well, dont write that. But yes. So do you guys want to see an amazing firstdate outfit? Yes. For sure. Oh, my gosh! I mean, I dont know. Wow. Gotta give it up, you look hot. Thank you for giving it up, shauna. Okay. Boy. I can hear you. What? Thats not a good date outfit. What are you talking about? Its glamorous, and its awesome. Girls may like that stuff, but guys dont. Um, I think I know what guys like. Maybe. Is your date with Elton John on new years Eve? Thats not funny. That is insensitive to gay men and to me. Morning, everybody. Good morning. Dr. shulman, do you like my outfit? Its glitzy. Got razzledazzle, like a fishing lure. But do you like it? Danny, you know, I like it because she likes it so much. Mindy, whats the occasion? First date. First date? Exciting. Remember, youre worth waiting for. He hates it. He didnt say that. Anyway, thats just my two cents, but what do I know? Im just a wealthy, single heterosexual male. Well, what do you think she should wear, Dr. Castellano? She didnt grow up in this country. Actually, I did grow up in this country, Betsy. Thank you. Oh. But answer the question. Easy, tight dress, shoes that wont make you complain about walking two blocks. Not a lot of makeup. Look hot. Keep it simple. Okay, thank you. Sure. Im just gonna take fashion advice from... Danny Castellano. Youre welcome. Cause Danny Castellano, he really gets women, you know? I do, dont I? Just ask his wife. Oh, Im sorry, his, um, exwife. You know what would really look great? Yeah? What? If you lost 15 pounds. What? Do you wanna get smacked? No, I dont wanna get smacked, Dr. Lahiri, not in my place of work. I want to peacefully go about my day. Jeremy: Do not listen to him. You are beautiful. Dont let anybody tell you otherwise. If you need me, Ill be in my office. Okay, okay, okay. Thats enough, thats enough. Were at work for Gods sake. Come on. This is really unprofessional. Oh, great, we broke this model of the human pelvis. Whats wrong with us? Im 31 right now. I cant do this kinda thing anymore. I need to give myself a chance. And if that doesnt work out, we could maybe resume this in my 40s, 50s, and 60s. Yeah, Im not gonna want to have sex with you in your 40s, 50s, or 60s. Thats really rude. And just so you know, when Im that age, Im gonna be super hot and have a bunch of really cute kids running around. Right. Meanwhile, you are gonna be some weirdo alcoholic trying to write a novel in Cuba. Poems, but... Doesnt matter. Right. You know what, Im gonna take this, because I dont think you deserve to have it. I need some pens. Oh. Got more pens. You look nice. Go to hell. Dear lord, please let this date be good. May he have the wealth of mayor Bloomberg, the personality of jon Stewart, the face of Michael Fassbender. The penis of Michael Fassbender. And may... Okay, okay. Im going, Im going. Hi. Im Dennis. Im Mindy. I just came from a delivery, so threw this on, raced over. Well, you look very pretty for having just raced over. I just wish that I had more time, you know, to get ready for this date. I mean, if it is a date. I dont care. We could just be here as bros, who cares? Not me. What should I get to eat? No, its a date. Oh. Lets see, what should I order? Im basically a vegetarian for moral reasons. I mean, I eat eggs and fish and hamburgers. Never steak. Well, you gotta draw the line somewhere. Wall street, huh? So you must have access to a lot of drugs. Actually, I dont have any access to drugs on wall street. Do you? No, no, no, I hate drugs. You know, I didnt know that pot and marijuana were the same thing until college. Really? Okay, so we were talking about how you grew up very handsome and how difficult that was for you. Can I just admit something here? Mmhmm. Carl warned me that you can be a little bit, not crazy, but dramatic. Carl said that? I will kll... To, uh, know why he would say something like that. That Carl. I just think its really funny because I find you so charming and downtoearth. Thank you. Yeah, I hate drama. My idea of the perfect night is... Staying at home. Staying at home. Yes! Eating, um, salad. Hello, Caprese. Yeah, yeah. Uh, miss? Theres a boy on the phone named Max. He says its an emergency. I, uh, respectfully decline. He says hes called you several times. Its the son of a patient. You know what, take it. By all means, its not... No, no, no. Theres a lot of doctors who can cover me, so hes just so attached to me. Kids love me. What do you want me to do? I dont care, babe. Just throw it away, hang it up, whatever you wanna do. Its your phone. I dont know what to tell you. You know what, just give me the phone. Give me the phone. Max. I am on a date right now. Do you know how difficult it is for a chubby 31yearold woman to go on a legit date with a guy who majored in economics at Duke? Mm, I never told you those things. I looked it up online, okay? Relax. Please dont pull at my heartstrings. Okay, okay, okay. Ill be there. Okay, damn it. Dennis, Ive had a great time, but I have to go. Oh. Yeah, I should be finished at, like, 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. You could just come over. All right. Oh, no. No, no, not like that. No, Im sorry. No, I used to be like that. Really? But not anymore. Not with you. Cause Im not... No, youre great. I would love... Okay. At least not first date. Sure. Third date, whole other story. Really? No, no, no, no. Because you, I like you, and I wouldnt want to ruin it with sex. Okay, its kind of a... Roller coaster ride. Taxi! live fast, die young bad girls do it well live fast, die young bad girls do it well chain hits my chest when Im banging on the dashboard my chain hits my chest when Im banging on the radio get back get down pull me closer if you think you can hang hands up hands tied dont go screaming if I blow you with a bang ah, suki, suki Im coming in the cherokee gasoline theres steam on the window screen take it, take it wheels bouncing like a trampoline when I get to where Im going gonna have you trembling Who would actually do that? Billy, dont run. Its new years. Go out and get laid, man. Danny, honestly, what is your problem? Whats my problem? Whats his problem? Id be pissed off if I was Meg Ryan and some guy interrupted my new years Eve like that. Id be like, hey, man, Im just trying to party with my friends and kiss some strangers at midnight. Like, leave me alone. What are you doing here? Never speak for Meg Ryan again. I wont. Im assuming your date is cancelled. Maybe I wont get married, you know? Maybe Ill do one of those eat, pray, love things. Ugh, no, I dont wanna pray. Forget it. Ill just die alone. So whos the guy? He was perfect, Danny. He was handsome, he had a job, he was exactly 7 inches taller than me, which you know is very important to me. Was he a man? What do you mean? Yeah, of course he was a man. No, I mean, like, was he a man? Danny, dont just repeat it and expect me to understand what youre saying. Was this the kinda guy who, if you heard glass breaking in the middle of the night, is he gonna jump out of bed, say, stay here, and look through the house naked with a baseball bat, or is he gonna hide under the covers with you? I dont know, thats a good question. Is this the kinda guy who is gonna get grossed out when you give birth, or is he gonna dry your forehead and tell you you look beautiful while all that disgusting stuff is coming out of you? I couldnt glean that from this one date we had. Is this the kinda guy thats not afraid to get into a fistfight at a Springsteen show because someone really disrespects him? Okay, okay. And hell just put it out... Okay, okay. And hell take em down right there, right now? Youre just talking about yourself. Im not talking about myself. Okay. Maybe theres some overlap. Yeah. You know, you actually didnt do a terrible job with that breech. I knew it, you stalker. I knew it, you were trying to steal my delivery. Well, sure, I never know when youre gonna get wasted and spend the night in jail. I gotta pounce on those opportunities, with the economy and all. Danny, that was kinda funny. What, with the economy line? Yeah. Yes. You know, this morning I woke up in jail cause I was broken up over a guy who fixes teeth for a living. Thats crazy. Now Im watching one of my favorite movies. I just delivered a baby into this world. I have a new patient. Thats great. This is working. This is progress. This is finally turning... What are you doing? Now were talking. I am sharing my feelings with you. I want to share this show with you. Its a great show. Ive seen this episode before. There are different episodes of this? Mindy: Okay, Gwen, let me defend myself. Because even though I messed up the date with Dennis, I think that he was almost too perfect. Like maybe he was a serial mrder or something. If hes a serial mrder, then Carls a serial mrder. Whos that? Uh, delivery. I ordered some clear soup. Clear soup? Thats not a thing. It is a thing. It is a thing. Tell your clear soup hello for me. Okay, I will. Hi. Hey, Gwen, um... Mmhmm. I really am changing though. I just feel very motivated, and tomorrow is going to be different. And you know what, if not tomorrow, then the next day, I swear. Okay. Okay. live fast, die young bad girls do it well\n",
      "LESLIE I love politics. Ive always loved politics. The game. LESLIE Some people say that politics is show business for ugly people. I disagree. Its show business for real people people whose talents arent dancing and singing, but rather talking and talking. LESLIE I just...I love the majesty of the political system. I live for it. I would say that my greatest dream is to be elected President of the United States of America. LESLIE My name is Leslie Knope. And I am the Deputy Chairwoman of the Department of Parks and Recreation in the city of Pawnee, Indiana. LESLIE Can you get wide enough to see the flag? RON Internal Auditing wants to remind all government employees that any gift given by a member of the public valued at over dollar 25 has to be reported immediately. EMPLOYEE Ron, what about, like, a gift certificate? Would that count? RON How much? EMPLOYEE Two hundred dollars. RON ...Yes. That would count. You cant win, just report it and add to the endless red tape. LESLIE Of course report it! Its the smart play. The last thing we need is the press breathing down our neck. Am I right, Ron? I am agreeing with you. RON Lastly, tonight is the Community Outreach Public Forum. Leslies gonna run it. RON We need one more. Who wants in? RON Tom. TOM Ugh. Fine. LESLIE Every month the city government holds a public forum and every month, out of over 600 city workers, Im the one they send. Its pretty cool. Whatever. No big deal. Just an honor. RON No one else wants to do it. Its a terrible job, going to some dingy rec center and getting yelled at by the public. I hate the public. The public is stupid. LESLIE Thisll be really good for you guys to see. This is where the rubber of government meets the road of actual human beings. When I go through those doors, I have to be on, like the White House Press Secretary. So. Deep breath. Lets rock and roll. LESLIE Thank you all for coming. My name is Parks Department Deputy Chairwoman Leslie Knope. LESLIE With me today is department member Tom Haverford. TOM TALKING HEAD TOM Yes, when I was 18 I changed my name from Aziz Abdul A1Rahman to Tom Haverford. The cold hard fact is that darkskinned people with funnysounding Muslim names just dont make it very far in politics. Yes, okay, fine, Barack Obama. Why does everyone always bring up Barack Obama? Thats one counterexample! LESLIE And yes, I do call myself a Deputy Chairwoman. Politics is changing in this country its not just a boys club anymore. There are 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling, thanks to people like me, and Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and, um... Margaret Thatcher. And Nancy Pelosi. The Parks Department is the site of another one of those cracks. And over the course of my political career, I intend to go around making thousands of more cracks in things, if not outright shattering and destroying them. LESLIE Big turnout tonight! Very exciting. LESLIE So fire away! Yes? MAN I am here because of a crime that is happening right now all over this city, that you people know about and do nothing to stop. LESLIE Thats horrible. MAN Will you commit right now to helping me stop this crime? LESLIE Absolutely. We want to serve you in any way we can. MAN Do you want me to tell you what the crime is? LESLIE Yes. Please, tell me, so I can help you stop it. I dont understand why youre being so mysterious about this. MAN Its abortion. TOM Abortions legal, dude. MAN You promised to stop it. I have it on tape! LESLIE Sir, first of all, that was a really mean trap. But more importantly, the city government doesnt have the ability to overturn a Supreme Court decision MAN I think you could, if you werent so lazy. Mayor Havlicek could. LESLIE Mayor Havlicek was mayor when I was a kid. He was quite an oldschool character. LESLIE He might have been able to overturn a Supreme Court ruling. He died in a small plane accident when he was thrown out in handcuffs at 20,000 feet. ANN Um...I have OTHER MAN When they gonna open up Ramsett Park again? Its been closed for a year. LESLIE Yes, we are trying hard to get that park reopened. There was a new problem recently...what was it, Tom? TOM Angry dogs. LESLIE Dogs. Thats right. There was a pack of scary dogs who were attacking the park workers, and we said, unh unh. Read our lips. Dogs cant bite people! LESLIE So we are looking into the problem. Whos next? LESLIE Yes, Barry, go ahead. BARRY Well, well, well today is a great day! Because last month they put me in jail. Thats right! And my mother had a restaurant in this town. A creamery. The head of the police is a ninth degree mason. TOM TALKING HEAD TOM There are a few regulars who always show up to our meetings and ramble on about stuff. Leslie says we should listen to them like wed listen to anyone else. I prefer: mocking them. BARRY One day there was a fire. And thats what killed my snake. Now I have a few things to say about Laura Linney. LESLIE Okay, Barry, thank you. TOM No, no, I want to hear what he has to say about Laura Linney. BARRY Laura Linney is a fifteenth degree mason. In the fifteenth degree they teach you how to talk with your mouth closed. LESLIE Okay, thank you, Barry. Thank you for your comments. TOM I agree with a lot of what he said. LESLIE This is valuable. Citizen comments. Whos next? ANN Hi. So, Im Ann Logan, and a few of us are here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street. LESLIE Alright. Go on. ANN Im a nurse, and frankly Im not at all interested in politics. ANN But this thing almost killed my boyfriend, so... Anyway, on this lot near my house, a developer dug out a basement for an office building, and then they went bankrupt. And now, theres just...this giant pit. ANN Its been there almost a year. LESLIE Twelve months, yes, go on. ANN It goes right up to the backyard of the house I rent. ANN And my boyfriend whos a musician actually, who I support, but who was really starting to make some contacts and apply himself in the music business anyway, he was cutting through the lot at night, and it was raining, and he just whoomp! fell right in. Broke both his legs. ANDY It was slippery. Did she tell you it was slippery? Because it was super slippery. ANN There was a little item in the paper. Unemployed man breaks legs in abandoned pit. Which why do they have to say unemployed man? That is inappropriate editorializing that doesnt belong in a news piece, in my opinion. LESLIE Its the gotcha media. ANN The point is, theres a giant hole in the ground and people are falling in. Ive been trying for months to get someone to fix this problem Ive written letters, and Ive made like a thousand phone calls to the government, but so far... She makes a zero with her fingers. TOM Who fell in again? Your boyfriend? Yeah. ANN TOM Is he dead? ANN No. But he broke his legs. TOM Uh huh. How long you guys been together? Is it a strong relationship? TOM Im not hitting on you. Im married. am only asking for background purposes. MARGARET Weve been to the Revenue Collection department, and the Transportation Department, and the City Manager, and we keep hitting dead ends. LESLIE Im sorry to hear that, but this doesnt seem like a government problem ANN Actually it is, because the government owns the land now. So youre going to have to figure out a different way to blow me off. LESLIE Well, guess what? Im not going to blow you off. ANN Really. LESLIE Yes. I will help you. ANN Is that a promise? LESLIE More than a promise. A pinky promise. I pinky promise all of you, right now, that I will help. And not only will we fill in that pit, but we will put a beautiful new park on that land. TOM What the hell are you doing? LESLIE Im getting in the game. ANN She claims shes going to help us. Whatever. Frankly she seems like kind of a simpleton. LESLIE Ive been in the parks department for six years, and until now Ive only really been able to engage in park maintenance. For example, last year I led the city wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after those problems with the cats. I heard some testimony from mothers of toddlers that would make you cry. But this pit! The chance to build a new park, from scratch... This is my Hoover Dam. TOM That sounds great. Problem is, anything over 25 dollars I have to report. So just call my wife and give her the suits and then if they dont fit her, maybe shell give them to me. LESLIE Hey Tom. TOM Alright Mr. Mayor. Nice talking with ya. Leslie! Hello. LESLIE That was the mayor? TOM Yeah. We were just rapping about some things. LESLIE TALKING HEAD LESLIE Tom is so lucky. I need to make the acquaintance of the mayor. TOM TALKING HEAD TOM I swear to God she is the most gullible human being Ive ever met in my life. LESLIE Brainstorm. How do I make this happen? TOM Go to the City Council directly, ask them to just front the money. LESLIE Nah, moneys tight right now. Parks arent a priority. I need more firepower. I need some bigger guns. Tom looks at her chest and snickers. TOM Yeah. Your guns are pretty small. LESLIE Tell me about it. LESLIE Tom and I work great together. Were both outsiders me as a woman, him as... whatever he is. I wanna say... Libyan? Plus hes the size of a child. Size twentyeight waist. Plus he worships the prophet Mahomet. TOM Tom Haverford cmon, Im Episcopalian. Three years now. LESLIE Well, obviously, what I really need is to establish a committee. Committees are power. They are the lifeblood of the democratic system. That was good. Did you get that? For the book? TOM Yup. Got it. LESLIE From time to time, I stumble upon a saying, or a phrase, that really sums up my feelings about things. Tom is helping me collect them, for my memoirs. TOM TALKING HEAD TOM No Im not. LESLIE What if we got Mark on board? TOM Mark who? LESLIE Mark who?! Brendanawicz! TOM Oh. Sure. Whatever. Call him. LESLIE You want something done in this town, you need Mark Brendanawicz. Hes a city planner and hes da bomb. Smart, capable, knows where all the bodies are buried. Just a great, solid, smart, big, strapping, solid guy. TOM She wants to bone him so bad. LESLIE What? Hey! Mark! MARK Hey Leslie. LESLIE Whats up, Brendanawicz, you crazy ol Polack? LESLIE Politics is roughandtumble. Yes, Im a woman, but to fit in I sometimes have to talk like a man, act like a man. You have to dish it out and you have to take it. MARK Crazy Oh my God. Mark, Im so sorry. Im just trying to kid around. Oh God. Oh God, Ive already screwed it all up. MARK Leslie. Im kidding. LESLIE What? Ha ha ha ha! I know. He he he he! Oh man. Good times. Politics. LESLIE So. Down to brass tacks. Do you know this pit Im talking about? MARK Yeah. Lot 48. I checked it out like a month ago. Its pretty gross. LESLIE As in a gross injustice! MARK Okay, but what I meant was, its disgusting. People have been tossing their garbage into it. And Im pretty sure there was a dead wolf in one corner. LESLIE Let me ask you this do you think I could turn it into a park? MARK A park. Huh. Well, when I think about the logistics, and the various hoops youd have to jump through, Id say: is it likely? No. But is it possible? No. Its not possible. You should give up. LESLIE What? Why? MARK Theres a million reasons why. I used to try to get stuff like this off the ground when I started, but between the developers and the citizen groups, the bureaucrats and the antigovernment nuts...its impossible. LESLIE So theres a chance. MARK ...No. There isnt. Aim smaller, is my advice. Have the wolf removed. You might be able to pull that off before Christmas. LESLIE Mark, I need your help on this. I need you to support it. LESLIE Can you do me a favor? For old times sake? LESLIE Mark and I...its complicated. You work closely with someone, two strong personalities, passionate about the same things, sharing a worldview...things can happen. We slept together. LESLIE A while ago. We didnt really talk about it much afterwards were both professionals, and it doesnt affect our work. I dont know. Some day down the line, maybe well give it a chance to become something more. Who knows. MARK TALKING HEAD MARK Leslie? No. Oh my God wait yes, we did! Wow, I totally forgot about that. Yes. Shes right. Like five years ago. After some kind of...party or something? I was pretty drunk. Anyway. Yeah. How about that. MARK Why do you care about this pit? Whats your angle here? LESLIE No angle. Ive been here six years, I know more about our city and the government than anyone else, and Ive never had my own project. Its not fair! Its like, were back in school and Ive studied really hard and theyre not letting me take the tests Imagine how frustrating that would be. MARK God if those tests had been called off, I would have been pissed. And those lousy snow days too. I hated those. LESLIE I know! Mark, I believe that government can do good things, but you need power, and getting this park made would give me power. The more power I can get, the more good I can do. If I had absolute power, I could do absolute good! MARK Your enthusiasm is...intense, and off putting LESLIE Thank you. MARK But take it from me its just not going to happen. LESLIE But I promised those people I would make this happen. I promised them in the meeting. MARK Well, youll just have to accept that you will be the first bureaucrat in history to make a promise and fail to deliver on it. LESLIE Not me! Why do I always think of the perfect response like one second too late? ANN Can you just straighten up your area a little honey? Theyre going to be here soon. ANDY Sure. ANN That parks lady is coming over, and were going to see the pit. Probably just a photo op for her, I bet. I still think theres no way the government Shhh. ANDY ANN Excuse me? ANDY Cmon, honey, if I wanted to watch the news Id be watching the news. ANN Im talking about the pit you fell in. ANDY But its boring. Thats why we have TV, take our minds off boring stuff like that. ANN Yeah, boring stuff. Like fixing problems. Dealing. Improving things. ANDY Yeah. Either one. ANDY TALKING HEAD ANDY Heres the deal. ANDY When Ann sees something broken, she feels obliged to fix it. I dont know why, and I dont really care. Its the only reason Ive eaten a hot meal in the last three years. LESLIE Hello, Ann. ANN Hey. Wow. LESLIE This is Tom Haverford, my loyal co worker. And this is Aubrey, our college intern. Shes going to document our fact finding mission. ANN Okay let me just get my purse... LESLIE This must be our hero. The man heard round the world. How you doing, son? ANDY ...Hey. LESLIE On behalf of the government of Pawnee, I want to say that were going to do everything we can to help you. Stay brave. ANDY Okay. Can you hand me that TV Guide? TOM So, youre a nurse. ANN Yeah. TOM Like, general nurse or some special kind? ANN General, but I get people ready for imaging tests a lot, so thats my specialty. TOM Do you have to shave a lot of wieners? ANN No. TOM Sometimes when I brush my teeth theres blood. ANN Well are you using a soft bristle toothbrush? TOM Extra soft. Do I look like an idiot? ANN You should go to a doctor. You might have cancer of the tooth enamel. TOM Oh god. LESLIE Lets go! Factfinding mission! ANN Right over there is where he fell in. LESLIE My God. How did we let this happen? Soil. Unstable. Crumbly. This whole lot could be vulnerable to mudslides. Aubrey get some pictures of this. AUBREY Of what? LESLIE Everything. This whole thing. ANN So, you think we can fill it in, plant some grass, maybe a bench or a tree? LESLIE Possibly. But dream with me for a second: why shouldnt this neighborhood have a first class park? With a playground, for kids. Do you have kids? TOM Id say no. ANN ...No. LESLIE Okay, but there are a lot of kids in the neighborhood, right? Kids that would love a shiny new playground, with swings and a softball field and a pool, and a jungle gym and tennis courts? And maybe over there: an amphitheater, for ShakespeareinthePark. ANN Its not that big a pit. LESLIE Well, some of those things. Think about it! A little playground arises from the ashes of a deadly pit. We could name it after your boyfriend. The Anns Boyfriend Memorial Park. ANN LESLIE The Playground. Itll take a little extra work, but why not try? ANN I think that would be great. LESLIE Good. Me too. Im going in. ANN Why? LESLIE I need to see it for myself. Dont worry. Ive got a hard hat on. ANN I see that. LESLIE Aubrey document this. The key to any factfinding mission is you have to really get into the battle zone. Like a President surveying a hurricaneravaged town. Or when Richard Nixon went to China, to see...you know, what the Chinese were up to. LESLIE A politician cant be effective if she doesnt see the problem firsthand. You have to LESLIE Fuck! Ow! Shit! God Dammit! Fuck it! ANN Whoa! Leslie! LESLIE Faaaaaaaaa! ANN Oh my God. Are you okay? TOM Lets ditch her. Itll be hilarious. TOM Hey, thats a good one. Email me that please. AUBREY Shes dustier in this one. TOM Ill take that one too. ANN Does it hurt a lot? LESLIE No. ANN Right. LESLIE How can you tell? ANN Im a nurse. LESLIE Thank goodness I was wearing the hard hat. ANN But it fell off. LESLIE After my head hit that rod. ANN Well, you should be all set now. Hey, you shed blood for the cause. Now were sisters. CONTINUED: LESLIE Ive always wanted a sister. ANDY I cant believe you fell in too. Thats hilarious. ANN Its not hilarious, Andy. ANDY Its pretty hilarious. LESLIE Thanks... Sis. ANN No sweat. LESLIE Okay. I am going to show my boss, Ron Swanson, our findings, and demonstrate how dangerous this pit is. Hell have to listen to me, with a broken clavicle. ANN Nothing is broken. LESLIE Trust me, its broken. Do you have one of those foam collar neck braces? ANN Seriously, youre fine. ANN Hey this is really cool, that youre helping me with this. CONTINUED: LESLIE Yes. Well, Im a public servant. Youre the public. Its my honor and pleasure to serve you. Ann smiles. LESLIE Why dont you come by my office later we can talk about the project, maybe grab some Starbucks, maybe gab a little. ANN Sure. Why not. ANN TALKING HEAD ANN I dont know. Shes a little doofy, but shes sweet. LESLIE I may have misunderestimated Ann. Shes very dedicated to the cause, like I am. At first, I thought she was just a...well, I hate the word bitch, it demeans women. I thought she was a bee yotch. But now I wouldnt say shes my best friend, but were very good friends, and getting better all the time. And health care is a huge issue. A hot nurse can be a very powerful political symbol. RON Explain this again. LESLIE I want a committee, Ron. I want to explore the possibility of putting a park on Lot RON Aw, that lot is zoned commercial. When the economy turns around, Ill have plenty of developers who would love to exploit that property. You were supposed to put this fire out. LESLIE Heres the thing, Ron. When youve been in the pit have you been in the pit? RON What? No. LESLIE Well, I have. RON When you fell in? LESLIE When I visited the bottom of the pit on a factfinding mission. And when youre down in the pit... well, you really get perspective about what it all means. LESLIE Ive been a loyal soldier, Ron, but I want my shot. Give me lot 48. Let me form a subcommittee, and explore the possibility of building a small park. RON Ill definitely think about it. LESLIE I like the sound of that definitely.. RON I dont want this Parks Department to build a park because I dont believe in government. I believe government is a waste of taxpayer money. My dream is to have the public park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations. McDonalds I think would be a good fit. Imagine a shiny clean McDonalds in every park. Corporations are so much cooler than government. RON This office is a symbol of how I feel about government: This M16 was given to me as a present by a prominent local gun dealer. I bought two and he threw in a third for free. People who come in to ask me for things have to stare right down the barrel. RON SWANSON What? The barrels been concreted. I would have to pull out this plug for it to be fully operational. RON SWANSON This is a partially defused Claymore mine. I want to remind people that asking me for anything is a minefield. RON SWANSON Thats my crown jewel. Its called a Czech Hedgehog, and it was used to keep Allied tanks off the beaches in France. It cost me eleven thousand dollars to ship it here. I had to have the floor reinforced. I like it. I think its beautiful. ANN Hey, hows it going? Is Leslie around? AUBREY What is this regarding? ANN Aubrey, its me. Its Ann, from the pit. MARK Lot 48, right? Sullivan Street? Im Mark, Im a city planner. ANN Ann Logan. Hi. MARK So I want to tell you I have a lot of respect for community activists. You guys get dumped on so much, but you keep at it, organizing the poor, and giving people a voice and really keeping us honest in the government. Really cool work. ANN I agree, but Im not a community activist. Im a nurse. MARK I feel exactly the same way about nurses. ANN Really? Exactly, the same way? How lucky for you that you didnt just make a really embarrassing mistake. MARK I know, right? Thank god. ANN Who else do you completely respect and admire in exactly the same way? Animal trainers? Rental car phone reservation takers? MARK Yup. All of them. MARK So why is a nurse taking on the system? Whats in this for you? ANN Oh. Well, between you and me, I own all the nearby lots. Im thinking if I can get the city to commit to fixing this, I can get it for a low price, bundle it with my lots, and put up a new mall. MARK Wow. Okay. ANN Im kidding. Theres a hole in the ground, its ugly and people are falling into it. Thats all. MARK I knew Leslie fell in. Tom emailed me a picture this morning. But who else? ANN ...My boyfriend. MARK He okay? ANN Yeah, hes fine. Hes great. MARK Whats he do for a living? ANN Why do you want to know? MARK Just making conversation. ANN Hes a...musician. Potentially. I mean, yeah whatever hes a musician. LESLIE There she is! And there he is! There both of them are! ANN Hey Leslie! LESLIE I take it youve met. ANN We have. How are you feeling? LESLIE Im feeling...optimistic. Waiting for news from on high about whether we get our committee. ANN Hey no matter what happens, I want to say thanks. I mean it. This is...way better than I thought it would be. Youre really fighting for me. LESLIE Well. Thats my job. You want a quick tour? ANN Sure...I have to leave in half an hour RON Are we meeting about something? MARK I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie and let her try to build a park. RON Why? MARK Doesnt matter. People like parks. RON Its a development lot. Restaurant, office building, something. MARK You owe me one. Remember? In fact you owe me several. RON You want to cash in for this? MARK Yup. RON Whats your angle? MARK Doesnt matter. RON Trading four years worth of favors for a park thatll never get built. Youve gone soft. MARK And tell her in the next 30 minutes. LESLIE There are 85,000 people in Pawnee, and this building contains the entire government. The Power Center. ANN This hallway is endless. LESLIE I know. We call it Archway Alley. Or sometimes just: The Hall. ANN Clever. LESLIE The building is called Pioneer Hall, named by the first inhabitants of this building in 1891. ANN Wow. LESLE Yes our crown jewel. These murals depict the battle of Conega Creek. LESLIE We put the minimum wage poster over the most horrible parts. ANN Thats...horrifying. LESLIE Yes. Come on Ill show you the DMV offices! ANN Awesome. TOM Hey! Leslie! We did it! LESLIE Yes, Ron Swanson has approved our request for a committee! LESLIE So exciting. This is my first committee, that Ill have headed by myself. Or with someone. First committee, ever, of any kind, for me. But...wow. I mean, in terms of my future? This is huge. Im barely 34, and Ive already landed a Parks Department exploratory sub committee! Im a rocketship. LESLIE To our beautiful new committee, a committee of dreams! And to America! TOM Here let me. TOM Leslie gets hammered a couple times a month. Its the only way I can tolerate her. MARK Hey just heard the news. Congratulations. LESLIE Thank you. Its very exciting. Do you think I should call a press conference right away? Try to get my picture out there? Or no I should wait. Dont want to overplay my hand. Okay. Good. So. Stay! Have a glass of champagne! MARK Why not. MARK Hey. Whats the story? TOM Dont bother. Shes ice cold. I already took a run at her and got nowhere. MARK Well, maybe youll do better tonight, with your wife. TOM Dude, why you gotta be like that? Leslie sidles up to Mark, fueled by liquid courage. LESLIE Well well well. Looks like you and I are going to be working together. MARK Looks like it. LESLIE Looks like it indood. Deed. Doodeedoo deedoo. ANN Cheers! LESLIE Ann, I promise you I am going to work my butt off to get this project done. No matter how long it takes. This butt is coming off! Ann smiles. MARK Thats our Leslie. Shes one tough bird. LESLIE America is a funny place. Its full of opportunities, full of hope, full of small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys. You justnever know, in America, when opportunity is going to strike. Are you excited? ANN Definitely. Im fired up. LESLIE Yeah! ANN Ive always heard that democracy, or whatever, only works if people get involved. Well, Im getting involved! LESLIE Thats right. Soul sistah, soul sistah, soul sistah! ANN Im a nurse, you know? People come into the E.R. with chopped off fingers and compound fractures LESLIE Like me, with my clavicle! ANN sure and if I can handle real blood and guts, I can handle this. Im making a vow here. No matter what, Im going to get that pit filled in, even if it takes two months! What? Whats so funny? LESLIE Wh0000000000! LESLIE At first the committee will just be the three of us and Mark. Well have our meetings on Anns days off. Now what to call the committee? TOM The SubCommittee for a Better Tomorrow. LESLIE Too vague. That could be about anything. TOM The SubCommittee for Improving Our Nations...Tomorrows. LESLIE Better... ANN Why cant it just be, like, The Committee to Fill In the Pit? LESLIE The name is crucial. It has to inspire confidence in taxpayers. The Tennessee Valley Authority. Man, dont you just want to give your money to that? Arent you happy that exists? How about The Extraordinary Sub Committee on Pit Enhancement? ANN That sounds like were making it bigger. LESLIE Pit Fixing? Fixation? Pit Betterment. TOM Pit Beautification? LESLIE Pit Beautification. Hi, Leslie Knope, Executive Director of the Departmental AdHoc SubCommittee for Pit Beautification. Boy, that sounds good. \n",
      "Michael: All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library? Jim: Oh, I told you. I couldnt close it. So... Michael: So youve come to the master for guidance? Is this what youre saying, grasshopper? Jim: Actually, you called me in here, but yeah. Michael: All right. Well, let me show you how its done. Michael: Yes, Id like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manageramanger. All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. Youre a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, Im sorry. OK. Im sorry. My mistake. That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... So thats the way its done. Michael: Ive, uh, Ive been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! PamPam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam? Pam: Well. I dont know. Michael: If you think shes cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. Pam: What? Michael: Any messages? Pam: Uh, yeah. Just a fax. Michael: Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? Theres a special filing cabinet for things from corporate. Pam: You havent told me. Michael: Its called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face. Michael: People say I am the best boss. They go, God weve never worked in a place like this before. Youre hilarious. And you get the best out of us. I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts. Dwight: Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum Jim: My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... Im boring myself just talking about this. Michael: Whassup! Jim: Whassup! I still love that after seven years. Michael: Whassup! Dwight: Whassup! Michael: Whass...up! Dwight: Whassup. Michael: What? Jim: Nothing. Michael: OK. All right. See you later. Jim: All right. Take care. Michael: Back to work. Jan: Just before lunch. That would be great. Michael: Corporate really doesnt really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because Im scared of her. Because Im not. But, um... Yeah. Jan: Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda? Michael: Um... Me no get an agenda. Jan: What? Im sorry? Michael: I didnt get any agenda. Jan: Well, I faxed one over to you this morning. Michael: Really? I didnt... Did we get a fax this morning? Pam: Uh, yeah, the one... Michael: Why isnt it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So whats the problem, Pam? Why didnt I get it? Pam: You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet. Michael: Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brothers, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesnt work great with faxes. Jan: Do you want to look at mine? Michael: Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you. Jan: OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we cant justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch. Michael: OK... Jan: Michael, dont panic. Michael: No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent. Jan: No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Dont panic. We havent made... We havent decided. Michael: All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringiedingieding! Jan: Ive spoken to Josh in Stamford. Ive told him the same as you and its up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other. Michael: OK. No problem. Jan: This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing. Michael: Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldnt wish that on Joshs men. I certainly wouldnt wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing? Michael: Question. How long do we have to... Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it? Jan: Go ahead. Michel: Packman. Todd Packer: Hey, you big queen. Michael: Oh, thats not appropriate. Todd Packer: Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today? Michael: Uh, I dont know what you mean. Todd Packer: Ive been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes? Michael: Oh, my God! Oh! Thats... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person. Jan: So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I dont want to worry people unnecessarily. Michael: No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. Like that. Phyllis: So what does downsizing actually mean? Stanley: Well... Oscar: You guys better update your resumes just like Im doing. Angela: I bet its gonna be me. Probably gonna be me. Kevin: Yeah, itll be you. Pam: I have an important question for you. Jim: Yes? Pam: Are you going to Angelas cat party on Sunday? Jim: Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous. Michael: Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I dont see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer. Michael: Hey. Ryan: Hey. Pam: This is Mr. Scott. Michael: Guilty! Guilty as charged! Ryan: Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today. Michael: Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges. Ryan: Yup. Michael: Watch this. This is Moe. Nyucknyucknyucknyucknyuck. Mee! Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. Its a guy thing, Pam. Im sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. Im htler. Adolf htler. Pam: I dont think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I dont think its many little girls dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks theyre good. Pam: Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Jim: Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing? Dwight: What? Jim: What are you doing? Dwight: Just clearing my desk. I cant concentrate. Jim: Its not on your desk. Dwight: Its overlapping. Its all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation. Dwight: You cant do that. Jim: Why not? Dwight: Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ. Jim: Well see. This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesnt bother me. Dwight: Downsizing? Dwight: Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on. Pam: You just still have these messages from yesterday. Michael: Relax. Everythings under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Thats important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. Pam: What? Michael: Come on. SixMillion Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, dont you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise. Pam: Dont we all? Michael: Im sorry? Pam: Nothing. Michael: If youre unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. Michael: I think Im a role model here. I think I garner peoples respect. Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP. Michael: People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that its really beyond words. Its really incalculable. Michael: Now I know theres some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight. Dwight: Im Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first. Michael: Assistant to the Regional Manager. Dwight: OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear? Michael: Im about to tell everybody. Im just about to tell everybody. Oscar: Cant you just tell us. Dwight: Please, OK? Do you want me to tell em? Michael: You dont know what it is. Dwight: OK. You tell em. With my permission. Permission granted. Michael: I dont need your permission. Dwight: Go ahead. Michael: Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch. Ryan: I heard they might be closing this branch down. Thats just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I dont really know. Oscar: Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here? Michael: Not gonna happen. Stanley: It could be out of your hands Michael. Michael: It wont be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that. Stanley: Can you promise that? Dwight: On his mothers grave. Michael: No. Phyllis: What? Michael: Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, Im a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it. Stanley: Its just that we need to know. Michael: I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then. Pam: I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe. Man: Are you sure about that? Michael: Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings. Dwight: Pam, information is power. Stanley: You cant say for sure whether itll be us or them, can you? Michael: No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then theyre gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Joshs people, but Im the head of this family, and you aint gonna be messing with my chillin. Jim: If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pams favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry. Pam: Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, hes on to me. Um... Michael: Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp. Ryan: Whats up? Nice to meet you. Michael: Introduce yourself. Be polite. Dwight: Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. Michael: Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything. Dwight: Uh... yeah I got a 78 280Z. Bought it for dollar 1,200. Fixed it up. Its now worth three grand. Michael: Thats his profit. Dwight: New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. Ive got some photos. Dwight: Damn it! Jim! Michael: OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here? Dwight: He put my stuff in JellO again. Pam: Dwight: Thats real professional thanks. Thats the third time and it wasnt funny the first two times either Jim. Dwight: Its OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because its so relaxed. Im a volunteer Sheriffs Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. Thats sort of one of the rules. Michael: What is that? Dwight: That is my stapler. Michael: No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food. Dwight: OK you know what, you can be a witness. Can you reprimand him? Jim: How do you know it was me? Dwight: Its always you. Are you going to discipline him or not? Michael: Discipline. Kinky! All right, heres the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop. Dwight: Yeah. Michael: And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwights personal effects into JellO. Jim: OK. Dwight, Im sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan. Michael: Nice. Thats the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round. Ryan: You shouldve put him in custardy. Michael: Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores. Dwight: OK, thats great. I guess what Im most concerned with is damage to company property. Thats all. Michael: Pudding. Pudding... Im trying to think of another dessert to do. Jim: Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink? Pam: Yeah. Jim: Thats why were all going out. So we can have an endoftheweekdrink. Pam: So when are we going out? Jim: Tonight, hopefully. Pam: OK. Yeah. Roy: Hey, man. Jim: Whats going on? Roy: Hey, baby. Pam: Hey. Pam: Roys my fiance. Weve been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think were gonna get married in the spring. Pam: Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys? Roy: No, no. Come on. Lets get out of here and go home. Pam: OK. Im gonna be a few minutes. So its only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes. Jim: You know what? You should come with us. Because you know were all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun. Roy: It sounds good. Seriously, weve gotta get going. Jim: Yeah, yeah. Jim: Um... Whats in the bag? Roy: Just tell her Ill talk to her later. Jim: No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do. Jim: Do I think Ill be invited to the wedding? Michael: So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that Ive created here is that Im a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punkd and all that kind of stuff? Ryan: Yeah. Michael: You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK? Ryan: All right. Michael: Just follow my lead. Dont pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I dont want to... Pam: You got a fax. Michael: Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first. Pam: What? Why? Michael: Why? Well, theft and stealing. Pam: Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen? Michael: Postit Notes. Pam: Postit Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents? Michael: 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand PostIt Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, youve made a profit... margin. Youre gonna run us out of business, Pam. Pam: Are you serious? Michael: Yeah. I am. Pam: I cant believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and youre firing me. Michael: But the best thing about it is that were not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. Im sorry. Michael: You been Xd punk! Surprise! Its a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you. Pam: Youre a jerk. Michael: I dont know about that. Michael: What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuhuh. Its the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17 or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child? Wow. Wow. Didnt work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked. Pam: Hey. Jim: Hey. Jim: How are things? Pam: Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with... Jim: Oh no, I just decided not to. Hows your headache? Pam: Its better, thanks. Jim: Good. Good. Pam: Yeah. Jim: Thats great Pam: Is...? Jim: Yeah? Pam: Um... Are you... Jim: Am I walking out? Pam: Yes. Jim: Yes, I... Do you want to... Pam: Yeah. Jim: Great. Let me just... Jim: Oh, Roy. Pam: Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend. Jim: Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. You know what, just come here.\n",

JAMES What about his subconscious? DR. COX Eisenhower was a sissy. By the grace of God, I think were gonna be okay. From now on, when Im in the room, youre not allowed to talk. DR. KELSO Now, Mr. Dorian, can you tell me what ailment... JAMES Im gonna love rounds. The constant questions, its like being on a gameshow. JAMES What is uremia? DR. KELSO Thats my boy. JAMES Uremia may lead to a symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy that tends to affect the lower limbs more than upper limbs, and is more marked aistally than proximally... DR. KELSO Whoa, sport. Who stuck a quarter in you? Nice, clean job with the foley catheter. I JAMES had a nurse do it. JAMES Thank you, sir. JAMES Unfortunately, Im still afraid to touch anybody. Id been thinking a lot about Elliot. Shes an analretentive, crazy, smartypants, but in kind of a sexy way, you know? DR. KELSO Dr. Reid, youre late. ELLIOT I got puked on, and seeing as it was already the fifth time today, I needed to cry for a few minutes. DR. KELSO Nothing wrong with squirting out a few. Youre off the hook if you can tell me what to look out for in a uremic patient. JAMES Anyway, I decided to go for it. JAMES Infection. ELLIOT Infection? DR. KELSO Thats my girl. Moving on... ELLIOT I knew the answer. JAMES Im sure you did. ELLIOT I was just frazzled JAMES How could you net be? ELLIOT You know, with the JAMES know. ELLIOT Good. But thanks, if I can ever do anything for you JAMES You could let your hair down again. ELLIOT Can I wash the puke out first? JAMES If you want. ELLIOT Well see. BOY. Daddy, why did you marry Mommy? JAMES Well Tiger, I gave her an answer during rounds and she immediately had sex with me. ELLIOT Now go do your homework so I can continue to satisfy your father sexually while never questioning his authority. DR. COX What the hell are you doing? DR. COX Did you actually page me to ask how much tylenol to give Mrs. Lenzer? JAMES I was worried that it could exacerbate the patients DR. COX Its regular strength tylenol! Have her open her mouth, throw a handful at her, and whatever lands in there is the correct dosage. JAMES But DR. COX And by no means are you to compromise our no talking agreement. JAMES Dr. Cox, if you could give me any advice JDR. COX Try not to kill anyone. JAMES Uhhuh. Dr. Kelso tells us all to stay positive. DR. COX Look, Im going to be careful because I dont want to overstate this: Dr. Kelso is the most evil human being on the face of the earth and may actually be the devil himself. JAMES Super. Its just that this isnt what I expected.Labs and tests and charts its all scut work. Plus most of my patients are... Older and kind of checked out mentally... DR. COX Pumpkin, thats modern medicine. Bureaucratic nightmares, paperwork out the ass, and advances that keep people who should have died years ago alive, when they lost what made them people. Your job is to stay sane enough so that when someone comes in that you can actually help, youre not too braindead to function, what!?! JAMES Do you think we should talk about this in front of DR. COX Her? Shes dead. Write this down, Newbie. You push around a stiff, nobody asks to you do anything. JAMES Thanks, youve been like a father to me. DR. COX Fine, you want some real advice? They find out that youre making nurses do all your procedures theyll throw you out on your ass so quick itll make you dizzy. JAMES And there it is. DR. COX Have a terrific day. OLD WOMAN Stop staring at me. CARLA Okay Bambi, heres Mrs. Lenzers tox screen, Mr. Hoberts blood work... JAMES I couldnt help wondering if Turk is having the same experience I am. TURK Im such a stud. JAMES Probably not. TURK This morning, I had my hands inside a guys chest. All the way inside I couldnt even see them.. I shouldnt be allowed to do that. JAMES And you werent scared? TURK Whats there to be scared of? You know what the attending said: One way or another, everyone stops bleeding. Thats deep man. CARLA No. its not. TURK Its a little deep. JAMES So, hey, we never finished before. I have to tell you about our apartment TODD Tman! TURK J.D., Todd. JAMES Hey, howre you do JAMES Can I talk to you? And like that, I was back in high school. You see, surgical interns, theyre all slice em and dice em. Theyre the Medical interns jocks. were trained to think about the body. Diagnose, test, keep everything on a little notecard. The medical interns, well... TODD Youve got a stain. JAMES Were the chess club. JAMES Im waiting for someone. JANITOR Doors broke. Every fifth time or so it dont open. JAMES Maybe theres a penny stuck in there. JANITOR Why a penny? JAMES I dont know... JANITOR Did you stick a penny in there? JAMES I was just making small talk. JANITOR If I find a penny, Im taking you down. ELLIOT Oh my God being on call sucks. Youre all alone, all night its terrifying, you know? JAMES The janitor wants to kill me. ELLIOT Anyway, about eleven hours into being on call last night, my twentieth admission was this young girl who was throwing up blood, and.. I actually wished it was me. JAMES You know, Ill bet hes killed before. ELLIOT Seriously, Id gladly be that sick to lie in bed, watch TV, get to eat hospital pudding, right? Right? JAMES Yeah, yeah, yeah, blood for pudding. You. know, were both off Monday night, so maybe, you know, if youre not. busy, I dont know, maybe we could. ELLIOT I like Italian food, the movie were seeing starts at 9, so well eat at 7:30, and please dont wear those shoes. JAMES Bottom line, Elliot is the girl of my dreams. DR. KELSO ..the necrosis, and infected stool most likely indicate what, Dr. Dorian? ELLIOT I dont know. Sir... JAMES I have no idea. DR. KELSO Well, Im very disappointed in you, son. Dr. Reid, can you help him out? ELLIOT Id say its superior mesenteric insufficiency. DR. KELSO Thats my girl. Patient number two... JAMES The only way to bounce back is to stay positive. JAMES Ms. Pratt,Im here to remove some of that fluid from your belly, relieve a little of that tightness. MS. PRATT Shut up and do it. JAMES Fantastic. Maam, Im going to need you to roll over for just a second. TURK Nice. JAMES You can roll back, maam. Now thisll just take a second... JAMES Cmon. Not in front of Turk. Just jam the razor sharp needle into her gut. JAMES I think this needle is too big. Im gonna get a nurse. TURK Learn by doing, man. Learn by doing. JAMES I hated him at that moment. For being able to do that, for being happy... TURK Maybe it was too big a needle. JAMES You think? How do I seal this up? TURK You want my gum? MS. PRATT Whats going on down there? TURK This is totally normal, maam. Just have to put some pressure on it. JAMES So, you going to move your stuff in tonight? TURK Thats why I came by. I just feel like weve done that already, you know? TURK It might be little... good for us to branch out a What do you think? JAMES Tell him you miss him. Tell him you need him to look into your eyes and say that everythings going to be fine just like he did when Tell him the cop pulled you over. JAMES Yeah, I feel the same way. MR. BURSKI I just have bad gas. Whatre you testing me for? JAMES We need to know if your gas could be harmful to others. JAMES Look, Mr. Burski, I heard a systolic murmur in your heart, which is most likely nothing, but if you dont let me check it out Im gonna worry about you all day. MR. BURSKI Seriously? JAMES Yeah, it would drive me crazy. MR. BURSKI Then Ill do it. For you. So whats it like being a young hotshot doctor? JAMES Did you ever go to see a movie that everyone told you was great, then because of all those expectations, you ended up totally disappointed? MR. BURSKI Movies nowadays have too many special effects. JAMES Yeah, that was pretty much my point. MR. BURSKI Kid,you want to know my philosophy of life? It might help. JAMES Lay it on me, Mr. Burski. MR. BURSKI The hell with everything. JAMES I like that. JAMES My first code. See, heres how it works. Someones heart fails , they beep in the first doctor who has to run in and tell everyone in the room what to do, basically decide the patient lives or dies... What, am I crazy? JAMES You chicken. ELLIOT Me? Look at you. JAMES Dont worry about the patient. Turk was already there learning by doing. TODD Fire up the juice, baby. TURK Clear. JAMES Plus it turns out the guy was just slightly anesthetized attached to a faulty monitor. JAMES I thought, I dont know, maybe we cared about each other. ELLIOT Oh please, if you didnt want to sleep with me you wouldve done the same thing. JAMES I didnt want to sleep with you. ELLIOT Uhhuh. And Turks getting married? JAMES Yes, he is... eventually: Ill tell you one thing. Theres nothing in the world that would make me sleep with you now. ELLIOT Do me right here. JAMES Okay. ELLIOT See? JAMES Damn. DR. COX Right. Hand me a trach kit, please? ELLIOT Great. JAMES Our date is totally canceled.JAMES I was sitting on the floor for two reasons. One, I tried to lock Elliot in that supply closet and she kicked me. Hard. And two, the oncall room was locked. JAMES Cmon, Ive got like ten minutes to sleep. TURK Tell me if Im going too fast. CARLA Lose the clothes. JAMES I heard that Turk was going to move in with Todd. Im surprised that highfiving freak isnt in there with him. TODD Look at you, Tman! Youre on fire! CARLA Nice. TURK Your turn. CARLA Nah, Ive gotta get back. But very nice. TURK Im off Friday, you feel like making me dinner? CARLA Que me estas Biciendo? TURK Or I could take you out. Your call. CARLA Date a surgeon? With the God complex and the marriedtothework? Hey Bambi. TURK You coming in? JAMES Thought I might wait for you not be naked. JAMES You look adorable. MR. BURSKI Ah, the hell with everything. JAMES Hey, I got your test results. Youre gonna be fine. One more night and youre out of here. MR. BURSKI Thank you. Thank you so much. JAMES No problem. PATIENT Nurse... Nursey... Cutie pie... ELLIOT Im a doctor, okay. The white coat, the stethoscope a doctor, got it? CARLA Relax. ELLIOT I just hate it. I hate the darlins, I hate the sweethearts... CARLA You dont need to tell me how hard it is being a woman around here. ELLIOT Well, youre certainly furthering the cause by wearing a thong to work and hooking up in the oncall room. ELLIOT Word gets around. CARLA You talk like that, do you even know my name? Im 34, I spend every second of my life either here, or taking care of my mom, so yeah, maybe I needed a little closeness. Im sure you never had a quickie at the club, or snuck some skinny, flatbutted, college boy up to your sorority room, and judge me? And my thong I like to think it makes my ass look good, and some days I need to feel good about something around here, and you judge me? Well, guess what. Word does get around, Ms. Out for herself, so you can dump on everyone here if you want, but you will not hurt me. You will not hurt me... JAMES Look at you making new friends. JAMES I couldnt get any sleep cause Turk practically had sex in the oncall room. DR. COX You are aware that I have no idea who Turk is, but good for him. Cause Billy, sex is lifeaffirming. Now, how bout you give me a urine sample, captain. BILLY But I just did five minutes ago. DR. COX Tell you what. This time put the cup on the ground and just go nuts. JAMES Seems like a good kid. DR. COX Yeah. Why are you here? JAMES Im worried about being oncall tonight. DR. COX Youre worried about being on call tonight. JAMES No. JAMES I dont think I can handle it. DR. COX You dont think you can handle it, do you? JAMES Stop doing that. DR. COX Look, worst case scenario, you kill someone and it hangs over your head your whole life, but thats absolute worst case. Jeez, Newbie, just use the nurses for all the stuff youre still too chicken to do, which is, if Im guessing, everything. And theres a really tough admission JAMES Call you? DR. COX God, no. I was going to say you can hide in the closet again. BILLY That was mean. DR. COX Yeah, maybe... You forgive me, pal? BILLY I will if you talk about sex some more. DR. COX Boobies. DR. KELSO Hey champ. First night on call starts soon, huh? Gosh, you must be excited. JAMES You betcha. DR. KELSO Oh, About Mrs. Pratt I heard that you want to put her on the hospitals transplant list. Just thought Id recommend sticking with dialysis a while longer. Maybe well get lucky. JAMES No problem. DR. KELSO Great. Have a ball, oncall. Little poem for ya. JAMES Ill check onyou every ten minutes, okay, Mrs. Marino? NURSE ROBERTS I need you in Mr. Burskis room. JAMES Are you flirting with me? NURSE ROBERTS He crashed while you were admitting in the E.R. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism, no way anyone couldve it. Anyway, you have to pronounce JAMES But the tests said he was fine. NURSE ROBERTS Could you just pronounce him so I can go home? JAMES Ill never forget that moment. The moonlight on his face. The stillness. The shame that all I could think about was how hard this was for me. JAMES Time of death 0200. JAMES The hell with everything. PIZZA GUY What happened? JAMES You were delivering a pizza to the emergency room, and apparently our sliding glass door malfunctioned, and you just ran right into the glass. Youre going to be fine, but you gave yourself a good concussion, so you might have a little short term memory loss, maybe some nausea. PIZZA GUY What happened? JAMES Oh, make it stop. TURK Man, I lied before, Im scared every second. Really? TURK Jeez, J.D., all the blood. Thank God for the surgical mask, man, cause without it everyone would know that I look like this whole time. JAMES I think its okay to be scared. TURK Yeah? I really need you to tell me stuff like that once in a while... JAMES He needs me? TURK Anyway, I just wanted to check on you. JAMES Just say it. JAMES You know the offer still stands if want to you move in with TURK Already took the keys from your bag. PIZZA GUY What happened? JAMES Ill tell you later. JAMES And like that, I got a second wind. ELLIOT Are you telling everyone that I screwed you over at rounds? JAMES Not everyone. Only the people that work here. Oh, and my parents. DR. KELSO Morning. Howre you holding up? JAMES Ahh, there he is. My safety net. DR. KELSO I saw that youre still pushing for putting Mrs. Pratt on the transplant list. Bad news though, sport, she doesnt have the insurance to cover it JAMES Yeah, but the ladys a second away from total renal failure DR. KELSO Uhhuh, Okay. Did you ask the Burski family for permission to do an autopsy? JAMES Theyre still in there with him... DR. KELSO This is a teaching hospital, son. Gotta ask. JAMES Just tell him how youll ask every time from now on, but you cant face those people again. Hell understand. JAMES Sir, do you think I could just skip this one? DR. KELSO Sure, sport. JAMES See? Every story needs a good guy. DR. KELSO In fact, why dont you just head home, you look tired. g.D. I am pretty tired. DR. KELSO Mr. Dorian, do you not realize that youre nothing but a couple of large pairs of surgical scrubs to me? For Gods sake, the reason I carry this chart around is so I can pretend to remember all your damn names. Now, if the patient has insurance, treat them, if not, show them the door. And if someone dies, you get the autopsy. You get it by rounds tomorrow, or Ill be crossing your name Off my chart, are we clear...? Answer me. JAMES Crystal clear, sir. DR. KELSO Great, sport. JAMES I dont get it. If hes a jerk, then whos the good guy? CARLA Car accident, he was stable in the E.R., went into arrest about twenty seconds ago. DR. COX We need to relieve the pressure in the chest. J.D., do it. JAMES Oh, God, no. DR. COX Look at me. You can do this. JAMES And I believed him... JAMES tray. JAMES Kinda. Oh man, oh man, oh man JAMES I cant pop it through the pleura. DR. COX Dont be gentle, cmon now... JAMES Connect it, please Carla. CARLA Normal rhythm. JAMES No way. DR. COX See? Piece of cake. Your patient. JAMES You dont have to go if you dont want to... DR. COX Your patient, Doctor. CARLA Go ahead. DR. COX Billy, apparently your parents are upset about some language they think you might have picked up here. BILLY Boobies. DR. COX Let me scare some sense into him. Lets hear it. BILLY Bagima. DR. COX Atta boy. JAMES So I guess thats it for now. Thirty one hours, twelve minutes and I am ELLIOT You finally off? JAMES Almost... I have one more really annoying thing to do. ELLIOT If youre talking about getting the Burski autopsy, I already called the family for you and they said fine, and to thank you, and Im sorry... They didnt say that last part, I did. JAMES The worst part was knowing right then that I could never forgive her. ELLIOT Im really sorry. JAMES I forgive her... You see, I cant survive on my own. JEFFERY Im a toolIm a tool. JAMES Even now, when I finally get to go home and go to sleep, in the back of my head, Ill know the hospitals still here. Wide awake. Waiting for me to come back tomorrow so it can try to beat me. CARLA Bambi, get out while you still can. But what the hell. The most important thing is that I got through my days without looking like a complete idiot. ELLIOT Get a gurney! CARLA Damn door... JANITOR If you ask me he had it coming. JAMES Im the man. \n",
      "BIG HEAD Hey, man, some guys from Zynga are throwing an allnight Perplexus tourney. Maybe we can find some Stanford kids to hustle. THOMAS Cant. BIG HEAD Goddamn, Thomas, thats a buttload of code. JIAN YANG Sheeeit, mother fucker you can like buy compression software. You dont have to fucking write that shit. You can buy that shit! BIG HEAD Or download a bootleg. THOMAS None of that CodeAcademy crap for my web site. The whole idea of Pied Piper is based on melody recognition. If it doesnt work perfectly, no one will want in. So, I am making it perfect. Hey, Dinesh, can you test this module for me? DINESH Can I eat your salmon? THOMAS OK. BIG HEAD Youre letting him test your module? THOMAS Youve got the Perplexus tourney. I want you to fuck those guys up. ERLICH And you wonder why there are never any girls around here. Hey Thomas, can we talk for a second? THOMAS OK. ERLICH Thomas, Im gonna have to ask you to vacate. THOMAS What? Why? ERLICH Youve been here six months. I gave you place a to live and plug in. Youve given me nothing. THOMAS Look, Pied Piper is going to take off. The website is up and running, it works great, it just needs ERLICH Pied Piper is crap. When you pitched it you said, The Google of Music. I thought it had Applications. THOMAS It does! Have you been on it since I revamped it? Once it takes off Pied Piper will be able to search the whole world of recorded music to see if there is a match. If youre a song writer... or a band... or anything, and you wanted to make sure you werent infringing on copy righted material, you could find out in no time. ERLICH First of all, nobody cares about stealing other peoples music. Jesus, they do it on purpose! Jay Z and Puffy made whole careers on it. THOMAS They didnt steal it, they had to get permission from the copyright owners... ERLICH They dont own dick. Theres no money in music anymore. Everyone involved in music is either stealing it or sharing it. Theyre all assholes. And theyre all suing each other. To stay here, you have to deliver. Or at least show some promise for fucks sake. ERLICH Like NipAlert. Big Heads app. It gives you the location of a woman with erect nipples. Thats something people want. Hows that coming along? BIG HEAD Almost ready to enter Beta Phase. THOMAS Look, I want to change the world. Make it a better place... ERLICH We all want to change the world and make it better. Like I did when I developed Accutran. A lot of companies use a lot of different software to aggregate social media feedback Frontier Airlines just happened to like mine. THOMAS You cant just kick me out. When I signed up I was promised a months notice if I had to leave. Its in writing. ERLICH Then I am giving you notice. I hope youre happy. You know, when I sold Accutran there were a lot of things I could do with my money. But I wanted to give back. I started this place to do something big. Really make a difference. Like Steve. THOMAS Jobs or Wozniak? ERLICH Jobs. Now, suppose Steve came back to us all reincarnated, because he was a Buddhist you know, and he showed up here at The Hacker Hostel looking for a place to help him get on his feet so he could launch the next big tech revolution. What could I do? Theres no room for STEVE. Can you believe this? I have to tell Steve to fuck off because there would be no room at the Inn because you and Pied Piper are here gumming up the works. See what Im saying Thomas? THOMAS That Steve Jobs is Jesus? ERLICH He was Buddist! THOMAS He was a poser! He didnt even write code. GAVIN BELSON Boodle brings the world to everyone. Boodle is everything. And thats what allows Boodle to make happy. THOMAS These rents are insane. dollar 2800 a month, dollar 4500 a month with five people! BIG HEAD You forget how goddamn expensive it is here. THOMAS I dont want to have to go back to St. Louis. I can barely talk to people in St. Louis. My parents still live in St. Louis! BIG HEAD You think Oklahoma Citys any better? And Im going to be the next one booted. Ever since GoolyBib landed two million in seed money Erlichs been on the warpath about monetizing. THOMAS GoolyBib? That Indian guy from Dropbox you were hanging out with? BIG HEAD No, its a startup GoolyBib. I think its a real estate app... or maybe its that traffic one. THOMAS Fuck. Every day somebody in the valley is hitting it big. But not me. If I cant pull it off now, when there are billions of dollars just LOOKING FOR A START UP, it might not ever happen. BIG HEAD Yeah, no kidding. THOMAS What are you worried about? Erlich loves Nip Alert. BIG HEAD Hes just blinded by boobs. Once he scratches the surface hes going to see theres giant holes in this thing. Its based on self reporting. I cant put sensors on women to report when their nipples are erect. I get one clown to send out fake reports and the whole thing collapses. I need something to make it objective. THOMAS Maybe I could develop an image recognition program, kind of like the melody recognition in Pied Piper. Big Head is coming around. BIG HEAD Or infra red cameras that detect changes in body heat. THOMAS Fuck, Im going to have to go to graduate school. I cant afford to stay here even if Im working full time at Boodle. GAVIN BELSON That is how Boodle can change the world. THOMAS Changing the world, one crappy app at a time. BIG HEAD Hey, did you hear what Peter Gregory is doing? THOMAS You mean buying that island in the Pacific? BIG HEAD Hes building one actually. Its gonna be this giant platform in the middle of the ocean. And I think hes designing a new monetary system for it. But anyway, hes also offering a hundred K to people willing to skip or drop of college to pursue any idea they have. I mean, it has to be really kick ass. THOMAS Pied Piper kicks ass. BIG HEAD Hes speaking in Palo Alto tonight. We should go. See if theyll let us talk to him. I dont know what happened to that guy, but he really hates college. Thomas considers this idea. Big Head eats another energy bar. Hes wired, tapping his hands, moving his legs. BIG HEAD Fuck, I dont know if its the energy bar or drink or gum but I cant wait for tonight. And I cant sit still. THOMAS Brogrammers. BROGRAMMER 1 A double machiatto for me. BROGRAMMER 2 Make mine a double double. BROGRAMMER 1 Yeah! BROGRAMMER 2 Hey, Tomas you been working out? BROGRAMMER 1 So how is every little thing? THOMAS Eh... not so good. Gotta find a place to live, so if you guys know of anything... BROGRAMMER 2 Youre leaving the Hacker Hostel? THOMAS Getting kicked out. Ive got a website that I think could be huge, but nobody gets it. BROGRAMMER 1 We might get it. Wed love to take a look. Whats it called? THOMAS Pied Piper. BROGRAMMER 1 Sounds amazing. Why dont you shoot it over to me and well give it a look. Maybe we can help. PETER GREGORY Gates, Ellison, Jobs, Dell. All dropped out of college. Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation because of DROP OUTS. We need innovation and we need innovators! Colleges are choking and strangling with conformity what the drop outs created through inspiration! PETER GREGORY College has become a cruel, expensive joke on the poor and the middle class that only benefits the perpetrators of it the bloated administrations and the myopic teaching staffs. Wages for graduates are going down. Employment opportunities for graduates are shrinking, but the cost of a higher education just keeps going up and up and up. BEARDED ACADEMIC You are a dangerous man, spewing ignorance! PETER GREGORY I dont think so. Im just saying that people should trust themselves more than a system that happily churns out unemployed debtors and provides dubious value. BEARDED ACADEMIC The true value of a college education is intangible. PETER GREGORY The true value of snakeoil is intangible as well. PETER GREGORY If you have a truly unique and brilliant idea I can promise you that any university worth its weight will crush it with their lack of creative thought and your now monumental pile of debt. BEARDED ACADEMIC Fascist. . THOMAS Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory? I have an idea Id love to pitch Monica cuts him off. MONICA There were sign up sheets to have a personal consultation with Mr. Gregory. THOMAS There werent any slots left. MONICA Im sorry. THOMAS I just thought I should talk to him before I give up and... go back to college. PETER GREGORY Dont! Wait, where? THOMAS I dont know, probably Boston University. PETER GREGORY Thats over fifty thousand a year. Do not do that. Go work at Burger King. Go into the woods and forage for nuts and berries. But do not go back to college! I think I have been played. Fine. Go ahead and pitch. You have until I fasten the seatbelt in my car. THOMAS Pied Piper is a proprietary site that allows you to find if your music is infringing on existing copyrights. Imagine if you were a song writer.... PETER GREGORY I dont think I could write a song. THOMAS But if you did... PETER GREGORY I dont even know if I can say Pied Piper is a proprietary site. Well I guess I just did but it wasnt easy. MONICA Crunching all those songs to find matches sounds like a lot of data flow. PETER GREGORY Yes. Yes it does. MONICA Look, why dont you send me the link for your project and well take a look. THOMAS Great, if you give me your email address Ill send you the link. MONICA Why dont you just write it down for me. BIG HEAD Sorry.. Im just thinking about... image recognition. ERLICH ...the airlines had a problem, and I had Accutran. So... wow me. PITCHER Ok, here it is: Bit Soup. Its like alphaBET soup but its all ones and zeroes. See its binary. Because binary is just ones and zeroes ERLICH I KNOW WHAT BINARY IS!!! Jesus! Ive memorized the hexadecimal times tables! Ask me what 9 times F is!! I dont need you to tell me whats binary and I dont NEED you thinking about soup. I NEED you thinking about code. This is Silicon Valley, not... ...Paris, Texas. Thats where Campbells Soup is. ERLICH Look, I got one slot opening up very soon, whos gonna get it? ROLAND So that thing is from the 1400s? BIG HEAD Not this one literally, but the sacbut is the least evolutionized of all brass instruments, so it would be the same as one from the 14th century. DINESH So do you guys play anywhere? Like clubs or anything? BIG HEAD Not yet. Were trying to play Street Fair this year. Problem is, theyre more into traditional Sacbut, which we can do, but it seems like it would be selling out or something just doing what people expect. ROLAND I dont think anyone ever expects a sacbut ensemble anywhere... THOMAS Everyone likes music. I cant figure out what it is about Pied Piper that people dont get? DINESH Applicability? THOMAS I dont know... Peter Gregorys head of operations said to send her the link but she was probably just shining me on. DINESHROLAND She? BIG HEAD Man, she was hot. ROLAND Why didnt I see her on nip alert? BIG HEAD Because I was too distracted. See, thats another bug I have to work out. LANGDON This is probably the worst time ever to be a laidoff publicist. TANDY Yep. Social media. LANGDON I know! There are no cool jobs anymore because everyone is out there blogging and doing it for free! At least youre working non profit. TANDY Im working the phones for mesothelioma for ten bones an hour and there are no parties. No galas. No deep pockets. No connections. LANGDON Remember those Pediatric AIDS fund raisers? Those were huge. TANDY Yeah, thats how I met Jerry Weintraub. He took me to Cannes. God, I miss the Hotel Du Cap. LANGDON Theres just no money in non profits anymore. Then I guess theres no money anywhere anymore. And I need a job. Im in way default on my student loans. Why the hell did they lend me money to major in Art History. Assholes!! TANDY Its fucked up. Wanna go to Vespio tonight? LANGDON I dont know, we keep running into the same guys. All the guys with money in LA seem to be old and fat. TANDY Except for the professional athletes. LANGDON Yeah, theyre hot but theyre all rapists. TANDY Yeah, or Christians. LANGDON I would even settle for a guy who wasnt rich as long as he wasnt a douche. TANDY Keep telling yourself that. I think you would be bored to death. My mom always says its just as easy to fall in love with a rich guy as a poor guy. LANGDON Not around here... TANDY I really should have married Tom when I had the chance. Id be living in a house in Malibu. I wouldnt be worried about getting older. Ive seen lines on my face. Well, just around the eyes, but they are there. LANGDON Eyes arent as hard to fix as necks and hands but... Yeah, Im not even getting carded anymore. LANGDON Why cant we meet guys like that? TANDY Geeks? LANGDON Yeah. Theyre rich and smart and theyre our age. TANDY Yeah, and they dont look rapey. But theyre all up North. LANGDON So a half hour plane ride away theres all these gazillionaires? What the hell are we doing here? TANDY Getting older. And poorer. BROGRAMMER 1 Lets look at this stupid thing. BROGRAMMER 2 You have to download your own player? Hey look at me, I traveled back to 2009! BROGRAMMER 1 Wait a second. Look at this file size. 1.2 Megabytes? No way! I know that song. Thats at least 3 on itunes... BROGRAMMER 2 Wow, that doesnt sound at all downgraded. BROGRAMMER 1 I really cant hear the difference. BROGRAMMER 2 And the file size is like, half. How the hell did he do that? BROGRAMMER 1 I have no idea. Some kind of new lossy compression I guess. JARED What are you guys listening to? BROGRAMMER 1 Were listening to 1.5 gigabytes of sound that should take up 4.5 gigabytes. JARED Do you realize how huge this could be? With all the data storage and data flow problems. The applications could be endless. GAVIN BELSON I want it. ERLICH Hey, Im being a good guy here. You can either get me a zip drive with any and all code you worked on or thought of working on while you lived here, or you can just clean the bathroom. Up to you. THOMAS A Boodle number again. Its probably those fucking brogrammers. They keep calling to tell me how bad my website is. I really dont want to answer just to hear about what an asshole I am. ERLICH Youre on. EAGER GUY My site is called Mashville. ANGLE ON THOMAS THOMAS I just want to put an end to this. Hi, Thomas Peckering, Im an asshole, tell me how much you hate Pied Piper. THOMAS What? Really? Wait, is this a prank? Can you prove its real? OK, Ill call right back. THOMAS Holy shit. OK... Ill be there. THOMAS I have a meeting with Gavin Belson... he likes Pied Piper. ERLICH I own ten percent of Pied Piper. THOMAS You said it was a shitty idea. ERLICH It was a shitty idea. Im not sure what it is now. Whens your meeting? THOMAS Right now. ERLICH Ill go change. THOMAS What the fuck am I waiting for? JARED Good to see you, Thomas. Now Gavin is running about thirty minutes late. THOMAS Well, its been forty minutes already so does that mean another 30 minutes from now then...? OTHER EXECUTIVE You should know Gavin is very excited about your site. Have you met Gavin? THOMAS Ive never even seen him in person. OTHER EXECUTIVE Its amazing. Youll just feel so energized after you meet him. Im a VP here and I only see Gavin about ten minutes a month. ANOTHER EXECUTIVE But that ten minutes is just incredible. Indescribable. Prepare to have your life changed. SENIOR VP I heard Thomas Peckering was here. Has he ever met Gavin? No? OTHER EXECUTIVE I told him its amazing. SENIOR VP That hardly begins to describe it. DESIGNER We really need to do something to fill that huge space up there. Now I know you wont like this idea, Gavin, but how about a nice, bold picture of you to fill it? GAVIN BELSON OK. But I dont want to just pose this time. Maybe we can get a shot of me... innovating. DESIGNER Perfect. SENIOR VP Ah, Gavin... THOMAS Hello? THOMAS Its Peter Gregory. GAVIN BELSON Its weird. They always travel in groups of five. Tall skinny white guy, short skinny Asian guy, fat guy with a ponytail, some guy with crazy facial hair and then an east Indian guy. Do they trade guys till they all have the right group? POWERADE REP Ummm... Im not sure, but we are very excited about becoming the official energy product of Boodle Corporation. You know our products are not just junk loaded with sugar and caffeine. I mean of course they have those but they really are an excellent nutritional product. GAVIN BELSON When I first started Boodle I worked those guys 247. Its amazing what you can get human beings to do for dollar 45 worth of ice cream. But the thing is, now everyone wants to be healthy... Get the fuck out. THOMAS Im actually outside Gavin Belsons office right now, Mr. Gregory. Here he is! Can you hold on a second? GAVIN BELSON So, Thomas Peckering is here! Gavin is looking at an overweight guy with a pony tail until Jared guides him over to Thomas. Gavin acts like he has just found a long lost friend. There you are, Tom!! Im sorry these gentlemen kept you waiting. He gives Jared and the other executives dirty looks. They do their best to look apologetic. Heres the thing I love what you did. THOMAS You REALLY like Pied Piper? GAVIN BELSON LOVE IT! Fill him in Jared! JARED Now, Thomas, of course since you developed this fantastic project on the Boodle campus while employed by Boodle, technically it is the property of Boodle, but Gavin is prepared to give you quite a nice raise and a promotion of course. THOMAS Oh, well actually Ive only worked here at Boodle a few weeks. I needed a job because things werent panning out and... well I created this site months before I got here. ERLICH Thats right! He created it while living AT MY INCUBATOR. BIG HEAD Sorry, he threatened to kick me out of the house if I didnt get him in. ERLICH Scott Erlich. GAVIN BELSON Ill give you dollar 600,000 for it. GAVIN BELSON But I am not just giving you dollar 600,000, I am giving you the full weight of Boodle. We have the reach and the muscle and the resources to take what you have done and push it to the global level. At Boodle we dont ask people what they want. We tell them what they want. And they thank us for doing it. Boodle can bring you the world. BIG HEAD Hello? Really? Wow. Sure. He hands his phone to Thomas. BIG HEAD Its Peter Gregory. I dont know how he got my number. THOMAS Hello, Mr. Gregory, Im so sorry. Oh, you heard that? Uh huh... Uh huh... GAVIN BELSON Ill give you ten million dollars for it! THOMAS Gavin Belson just offered me 10 million dollars for Pied Piper. PETER GREGORY Ten million? Im prepared to give you one hundred thousand dollars. THOMAS Peter Gregory offered me one hundred... ...thousand? PETER GREGORY File size is a problem that is never going away. That makes your compression code very valuable. Ask yourself this, Thomas: Did you come out to Silicon Valley to make ten million dollars and disappear? Or did you come to make billions and leave your mark? You could be up there with the greats. THOMAS Mr. Belson, I have a great idea! Peter Gregory is only interested in the compression algorithm I created, so I could do Pied Piper with you and develop the compression technology with him. GAVIN BELSON The compression is the only thing about the fucking stupid site I DO WANT!! GAVIN BELSON Dont be an idiot. Im offering you real money. Ten million, right now. THOMAS Excuse me... I...I need to use the bathroom... THOMAS So what would my position with the company be? JARED Your position? THOMAS What would I be doing? SENIOR VP You could just think of something else genius. THOMAS And you guys would own it? SENIOR VP Well, yes, as per the terms of the contract. But THOMAS Yeah, I meant to ask you about that, this contract is for thirty years. SENIOR VP Yes, the ten million is paid over thirty years. THOMAS This looks like a restraining order. JARED Yes, well, Gavin is a very busy man... and he doesnt want to get in your way... or you in his. Its not necessarily a bad thing. MONICA Whoa, someones on edge. THOMAS Yeah, maybe. Wonder why. MONICA Well, I came by to let you know that whoever you go with, everything will be just fine. Boodle is creepy and Peter is... well nuts, but you have two of the biggest players in Silicon Valley fighting over you. Enjoy it. THOMAS Yeah, I dont see that happening. I have to make the most important decision of my life! And Im not good at making those kinds of decisions. MONICA So, what kind of decisions are you good at making? THOMAS Technical ones. Fixes. Cracking code and making it work. And then making it work better. I like having discreet reducible problems and solving them. Im not much of a big picture guy. MONICA Maybe you are and maybe you arent. Maybe you just need bigger problems to solve. THOMAS So, Peter Gregory sent you here to offer me bigger problems? MONICA Nobody sent me over here. MONICA When you dont try to see the big picture you miss a lot. Even things that are right in front of you. THOMAS Ive been thinking about this a lot, and I think Boodle is a great opportunity, but Im a little fuzzy about just what exactly I would do. GAVIN BELSON You can do anything, learn to play zithers, play DD all day long. Hell, grow a pony tail, grow pigtails, I dont care. JARED What Gavin is saying is that youll have complete freedom. THOMAS Well, its just that I kind of want to be a part of something. I want to help take this to the next level. So I was thinking maybe if we became partners... GAVIN BELSON Im willing to give this dickhead thirty million dollars if I never have to talk to him again! JARED Gavin, were still on speakerphone. GAVIN BELSON I know! LANGDON It looks like a Four Seasons but sure as hell doesnt feel like one. TANDY OK, I have never felt less sexual energy in my life. GUY Hey girls. My names James. I started Zcranium.com. We just got two million in start up money. TANDY Oh really? So youre like, a programmer or...? GUY Fuck yeah! I was writing code when I was 8. I was a math wizz Sergie Brin?! Larry PAGE?!! Fucking Larry Elllison??!!! Theyre NOTHING! Im a tenth level magic user!!! TANDY This is it? This is where all the tech billionaires decided to live? LANGDON It cant be. Excuse me, is this Palo Alto? LANGDON It looks like its all guys. Thats gotta be good, right? JIN YIANG This bullshit. Why I gotta buy beers? That motherfucker just get 30 million dollars from Boodle. ROLAND Cause you never pay for shit, Jin Yiang. And this is a big night for Thomas. JIAN YANG Why you talk fucked up like that? ROLAND Just cmon. LANGDON Thomas. TANDY We can still catch the late flight back to LA. LANGDON Were not going anywhere. ERLICH You dont want to work for assholes and now you dont have to. Youre like me you want to build something. JARED He turned down 30 million dollars? GAVIN BELSON Well, look at it this way I have 30 million dollars that Im going to use to destroy that sad, pathetic, stupid prick. THOMAS With this new company were really going to try and do things right. First order of business changing the name. Yes, I know Pied Piper sucks. THOMAS Oh... Hey. I turned down you guys. And my decision is final. JARED I know. And I respect that. As a matter of fact, thats all I can think about... that you turned down 30 million dollars because you cared about something. You were passionate about something. I want to feel that way. I want to work for you. I dont know if Gavin will give me a good recommendation but Im really fucking good at business development. THOMAS It always sounded like bullshit when every guy with a start up said that they wanted to change the world Okay, it still sounds like bullshit... but maybe we can make our mark. ERLICH AND MAKE SOME MONEY!!! THOMAS Were going to need some energy drinks. BIG HEAD Big ones. \n",
      "Narrator: The American superstore. Onestop shopping for everything you could ever want or need. Do you want to be thinner? Fatter? Happier? Sadder? Are you looking for friendship? Or solitude? Or even love? Amy: Thats actually a cubic zirconia knockoff. Its called PlastiClear. Bo: What happened to the dollar 8 ones? Amy: Were all sold out of those, sorry. But this ones only dollar 2 more. Bo: I get it. You advertise the cheap jewelry to get the suckers in the door, then you push the expensive stuff. Amy: Well, I wouldnt use the word suckers or expensive or jewelry. Bo: Fine. I got to stand in line for cigarettes anyhow. Amy: Great. I hope you and your fiance are very happy together. And that you dont procreate. Glenn? Glenn: Huh? Amy: Im taking a mentalhealth break. Glenn: Okay. Have fun now. Reflect. Dina: Just checking over your new hire forms. American citizen. Nice. No dependents. Me neither, unless you count my birds. It just doesnt say anywhere on here if youve got a girlfriend. Jonah: I didnt, is there a space for that? Dina: Theres this section here, Is there anything else we should know? Some people like to volunteer it. Jonah: Oh. Umm, then also no. Dina: No. Jonah: No. Dina: Okay, well, I will just jot that down, then. But you are heterosexual, right? Jonah: Are you allowed to ask that? Dina: No. Amy: Smart. We always keep the best rolls right in the middle. Oh, wait. Jonah: No, no, no. Let me help you with that. Amy: Oh, no, no, no. Im fine. Jonah: Its fine, I work here. Its, like, my its my job to help customers, so. Amy: You work here? Since when? Jonah: Since right now. Im, its actually my first day. Amy: Oh. Jonah: I know. I dont seem like the kind of person who would work in a place like this. Amy: Yeah, thats why I was so surprised. I was like, What? What? Him? Whats he doing cleaning up toilet paper? I think its because you just you have this very intelligent, educated, more cultured quality, I mean, compared to yeah. Jonah: Oh, hey. Look, I get that youre complimenting me, but it might sound a little condescending, so, you know. Amy: Oh, yeah, thanks. No, I wouldnt want to sound condescending in front of somebody who works here. Jonah: Right. Cheyenne: Hey, can I run out for two minutes? This thing is kicking my bladder like it owes him money. Jonah: Oh, you know what, Im actually not in charge. Amy: Yes, of course. Ill take Carly off express. And Vivian can bag, so take as long as you need. Cheyenne: Ah, thanks. Amy: Little tip. Dont let the other workers here know how much better than them you are. They hate that. I dont know why, maybe because it sounds condescending. Welcome. Dina: All right, campers, listen up. Ive got an important announcement. This is your garden variety generic decongestant. And this is crystal meth, okay? The tweakers use this to make this. So stop selling them this, so they cant make this. Cheyenne: That guy told me he had a really bad cold. Dina: He was buying 35 boxes, Cheyenne. That should have been a red flag, okay? Use your noggin. Glenn: Lets thank Dina for that helpful tip of the day. Thank you, Dina. Garrett: Am I the only one that thinks its weird that she walking around with a bag of crystal meth? Jonah: Hey, listen. I think there might have been a misunderstanding. Im not an elitist, so... Amy: Oh, elitist? What is that? Jonah: Like, a person who thinks theyre better than ... you know what elitist means. Amy: Oh, yeah. They learnt that to us in public school. Glenn: Anyway, I am so proud to welcome two new angels to our Cloud 9 family. Why dont you introduce yourselves? Okay. Jonah: Hello, everyone. I am Jonah. And I am I am excited to be here. This is gonna be fun, so. Mateo: My name is Mateo Fernando Aquino Liwanag, and Im here to make something of myself. Spread my wings Whoo! See how far I can fly. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Jonah: Yeah, I, too, would like to see how far I can fly. So. Garrett: Saved it. Jonah: Thank you. Glenn: Now, I used to end these meetings with some wisdom from the Good Book. But then someone reported me to corporate. Dina: Heck yeah, I did. Look, Im a Christian too, but in these four walls, my bible is the employee code of conduct. Glenn: We all thank you for it. Dina: Yeah, youre welcome. Glenn: I pray for you, Dina. Dina: I pray for you, too, Glenn. Glenn: No, Im praying right now. Amy: Im praying so hard. Glenn: Im praying harder than you. I know how. So to welcome our new employees. Welcome. Welcome to Cloud 9. Garrett: This is my jam. Jonah: Hey, do we have any kind of training? Ive just been wandering from one department to another, trying to look like I have purpose. Garrett: It works better if you carry a box. There you go. See? Youll learn as you go. Look, man, only a couple things to remember: always show up on time, dont steal, and stay on the floor supervisors good side. Jonah: The floor, whos the floor supervisor? Garrett: I got to go get another box. Jonah: Hey, can we can we start over? Im Jonah, as you know. And youre Ramona. Amy: Nope, that is not my name. I just dont like random strangers using my name like were buddies. Jonah: Right, like how hookers dont like to be kissed on the lips. Amy: Did you just compare me to a hooker? Jonah: No. Amy: You look bored. Let me help you with that. All electronics are supposed to be 25 off, but our POS system is down. So you scan, hit reassign, enter, override, yes, reduce 0.25, enter, yes, yes. You are not paying attention. Jonah: Im sorry. Go ahead. Amy: Confirm, enter, yes. Got it? Jonah: If I guessed your name, would you tell me if I was right? Amy: Take this. Cheyenne: Oh, its so pretty! Jonah: Ill make a list. Uptight Lady: Oh, excuse me, miss. Do you know the difference between a stool softener and a laxative? Amy: Ill be right with you, maam. Cheyenne, whats going on? Cheyenne: My boyfriend just asked me to marry him. UptightLady: I dont want it soft. I want it out of me. Amy: You know, I hadnt realized earlier that Cheyenne was the lucky girl youd be proposing to. Bo: Yeah, well, I knocked her up, so my dad says I have to. Cheyenne: So romantic. Bo: Thats how I do it, yo. 100 love. UptightLady: Bulking agent? Why would I want more bulk? Ugh. Amy: Chey, you didnt say yes, did you? Cheyenne: Why wouldnt I say yes? Amy: Um Cheyenne, look at me. I know how easy it is to get swept up in the romance of all of this. But think it through, okay? Dont do something youre gonna regret for the rest of your life. UptightLady: Yeah, okay. Im gonna go sleep on it. Jonah: Hey. I think I got it down. Mateo: No offense, but youre my competition, so Im kind of actually rooting for you to fail. Okay, thanks. Bye. Jonah: Hey! I figured it out. Amy: We need new shelf flags for the end caps, but we should check the DCPs first, because last time. What is happening? Glenn: Could it be a race riot? Its so hard to tell in the early stages. Could be the rapture, but then why am I still here? Jonah: Hey. I am killing it over here. Amy: Youre only discounting everything 25, right? Jonah: Yeah, scan, reassign, yes, override, yes, reprice. Amy: Reduce. Jonah: Huh? Amy: Reduce 0.25. Reprice 0.25? That would change everything to 25. Shut it down! Shut it all down! Cheyenne: If you sign up for our Heavenly Shoppers program today, youll save 15 off your purchase, which would drop your price to 22. Amy: Stop selling everything! Shut it down! Shut it all down! Sir, you need to stay right there. Frank, nobody leaves! Maam! Maam, Im sorry. Im gonna need to recheck some of these items. SoccerMom: No thank you, buhbye. Amy: Im sorry, I cant just let you leave with a whole basket full of 25 tech, oww! SoccerMom: I have more where that came from, lady! Amy: Oh, I dont think so! Garrett: Attention, shoppers. Due to an employee error, very expensive electronics are pricing out at 25. This mistake is being corrected, so stock up quick! Go, go, go, go! Jonah: What Im trying to say is, this is not 25. Sir, no. No twofive, no. SoccerMom: It touched my car its mine! Amy: Thats not a thing. SoccerMom: It is a thing. Mateo: I dont want to be that guy, but if you had to compare my performance versus Jonah, uhh, okay. Garrett: Yeah, you better hurry up, girl. You better get that TV. Frank : Stop, stop! Please, Im begging you! Jonah: Shes very, shes, theyre very pretty, yep. Amy: Ow! Frank! Frank: Yall dont want to do this. Please! Dina: Sales over! Glenn: Theres no need to identify whoever it is whose fault this was. We can all learn a lesson here. Mateo: Would that lesson be not letting Jonah reprice inventory in the future? Glenn: It might be, yes. All right. Punctuality. I do not tolerate it, because I do not tolerate it in myself. I am an angry man, so I get places early... Jonah: Hey do they allow employees to date supervisors? Garrett: I dont know. Why? Jonah: Just curious. Glenn: Lets always remember, the customer is always right. Jonah: Hey, whatsyourname, check it out. Amy: Ah. I was wondering what was taking so long to stack a few cans. Jonah: I just I wanted to reiterate how sorry I am about before. Amy: And when a customer wants a can of ginger root beer and the whole thing collapses on top of them, how are you gonna feel then? Jonah: I was just trying to have some fun. Amy: This might be a cultural thing, but around here, the less screwing everything up you do, the better. Jonah: You talking about the cans or the pricing thing? Amy: You see, the fact that its your first day and theres already more than one option of things you screwed up is not a good thing. Jonah: Okay, Ive made some mistakes. I can admit that, but that doesnt mean we cant have a little fun at work, does it? Or try and find some moments of beauty in the everyday? Amy: Wait, Im sorry. Did you really just use the phrase moments of beauty, like, conversationally? Jonah: Okay, yes, thats cheesy, but do you remember American Beauty? Even a plastic bag can be breathtaking. Amy: Wow. That really blew my mind. Like, boom, I have goose bumps. Jonah: I felt something. Im Jonah. Its my first day. Cheyenne: Okay. Stay still. Dina: I dont usually wear eyeliner. Sharpie occasionally, but... Cheyenne: So tell me about this special guy. Dina: Okay. Male, Caucasian, no discernible scars or tattoos. Cheyenne: Sounds dreamy. Dina: Yeah. Cheyenne: You know, speaking of boys, Ive got a pretty big decision to make. My boyfriend, he... Dina: Im glad we could bond like this. Thank you. Mateo: Excuse me, excuse me! Hi! I hung up everything that was in the dressing rooms, and I organized it by style, color, size, and relevance of designer. Amy: Wow. Good job. Mateo: I enjoy hard work. Its just like my mom always said: If you dont work hard, Baby Jesus will cry. Amy: Okay. Mateo: I dont think I could be happy fooling around in the parking lot like the other new guy. Jonah: Slow down! This is not fair! You have more experience on wheels than I do! Garrett: Your disability is not my concern! Amy: Seriously? The only thing I asked you to do was put the carts away. Jonah: Thats what Im doing, just somewhat circuitously. Garrett: See you later, sucka! Amy: Are you trying to get fired? What if Glenn sees this? Glenn: Coming through! Move! Jonah: That doesnt count. Glenn: Go, Glenn! Yeah! Yeah! Yes! In your faces! Your faces! Haha! Amy: Okay. I get it. Youre the fun guy. Im the stick in the mud. Well, I could be fun. I could have fun. Lets have fun. Jonah: Of course you can have fun. Amy: Whoo! Were playing at work. Jonah: No brakes! I have no brakes! No ooh! Amy: Peace offering. Jonah: Are those the flowers that I picked up off the floor of the garden center? Amy: Yes. Jonah: Theyre beautiful trash flowers. Amy: Look, Im sorry, okay? I have been having a long day. Ten years of long days, actually. You know, I stock these glow stars every single year for the backtoschool sale. And then I take them down, and I put up the Halloween inventory, and then Thanksgiving and Christmas and Valentines Day and Easter and Fourth of July, and then backtoschool again. Jonah: Hmm. That sounds incredibly not fun. I see why you love it here. Amy: Its a good job. But tomorrow is gonna be just like today, and I know that because today is just like yesterday. So sometimes its just kind of hard to find those moments of beauty. Garrett: Attention, shoppers. Even a big box store has to close, and its about that time. You know, when Pandora closed her famous box, there was only one thing left inside hope. I wonder what will be left inside of this box. Could it be Grace? I hope not. If youre Graces parents, please pick her up at customer service. Mateo: I took the initiative upon myself to reorganize the toy section for the convenience of adult shoppers. It was just feeling overly whimsical. Jonah: I want to show you something Ive been working on. Mateo: Oh. You were working. Where? Because Ive been in every single department, and I havent seen you in a couple hours, unless you were in, like, the break room maybe. Bo: Everybody get down on the ground, now! Get down, get down, get down! Touch the ground! Or get out! All right, calm down. Do what I say, and nobody gets hurt. Dina: This is what I trained for. Bo: Now, Im gonna start killing somebody every minute, unless unless you agree to marry me, Cheyenne. Hit it! Garrett: Hey, what the... Bo: Ill say, Will you marry me? Jonah: I had nothing to do with this. Amy: Yeah, I know. This is the fault of YouTube. Bo: Heard you want to walk down the aisle. Your baby needs a daddy, weve been bangin for a while. All right, I pay the consequences of my actions. Dont try to change me cause Im a man of action. Glenn: Yo! What a show. Dina: Im calling to report a code green in progress. I repeat, code green. Operator: Whats a code green? Dina: I faxed you a list of codes last month! Hostage situation! You need to get SWAT down here right now! Bo: When all these people gonna learn? Were gonna get burned, just waiting for our turn. Yo, BlackLivesMatter, yall. Okay, if you like what you heard and saw, Im currently seeking representation in all areas. Also, I do modeling, so Im just throwing that out there. All right, peace out, St. Louis. Cheyenne: Bo! Bo: What? Oh, my bad, yo. Cheyenne Tyler Lee, will you marry me? Or are you gonna be, like, a dick about it? Dina: Oh, I think hes about to shoot a hostage. Ill do what I can. Operator: Dont do anything. Amy: What is this? Jonah: Moment of beauty? Garrett: To Cheyenne. All: Cheers! Garrett: May your marriage be as sweet and colorful as this Cloud 9 brand caffeinated malt beverage, without the recall for killing college students. Cheyenne: Thank you, on behalf of myself and Bo. Amy: Well, he did make it memorable. Ill give him that. Jonah: I mean, most guys dont even bother threatening to kill you when they propose. Dina: You were never in any real danger. You know that, right? Jonah: Yeah, I know. It was a fake robbery. Dina: This is a highvelocity 440grain lead flatnose projectile with gas checks and a boxerprimed brass jacket. If hed come within 10 feet of you, you would have seen his head explode like a watermelon. Cleanup on aisle I dont even know what aisle it is, cause his brains would be splattered all over the sign. Oh, shoot. Cheyenne: You know, I wish that we could wear jewelry at work. Amy: Oh, its so sparkly. Cheyenne: You know, I thought about what you said about not doing something that I might regret, but then, in the moment, you know, under the stars, it just felt right. Without you, I would have never said yes, so thank you. Jonah: Oh. Cheyenne: Well, I should go bail out my boyfriend now. Or I mean bail out my fianc! Glenn: Aw. Amy: All right. I got to get going. Good night, everyone. All: Good night. Jonah: Hey, wait up. Wait up. Hey, I didnt mean to... that, in there... I just wanted today to feel different than yesterday. Amy: Well, then you completely failed, because that exact same thing happened yesterday. But thank you. Jonah: Okay. Amy: I really do have to get going. See you at work tomorrow, Jonah? Jonah: You certainly will champ. Amy: Amy. Jonah: Nice to meet you, Amy. Garrett: Yo, you should come with us, man. Were gonna throw some mannequin limbs in the dumpster and watch garbage men freak out. Jonah: That sounds awesome. Garrett: It is awesome. Come on. \n",
      "GARY Thats a fork, Madam Vice President. SELINA Thanks for the debrief, Gary. ANNA ..and the VP also needs to meet with Senator Hallowes. Ten minutes, preferably 20, and you might want to make that happen in the next five minutes, preferably two. GARY I meant its one of the new cornstarch forks. I was differentiating it from the spork... The hybrid spoonfork. ANNA Im just wondering if your imminent meeting on Senate vote reform might be more important than a spoonfork? SELINA Sure, but you know how slowly that stuff goes. Like fucking stopmotion animation: eliminate anonymous holds here, sliding scales for cloture there just a whole bunch of procedural clitdiddling. But this is classic are you Listening...? ANNA I am. Im one huge ear, tuned only to the frequency of your voice. SELINA This is classic Clean Jobs Commission stuff biodegradable cornstarch utensils in most government buildings by the fall.

SELINA Is that the breastfeeding legislation? GARY It is, Maam. ANNA And then just various VP things: Vaguely Personable, Viagra Prohibitor and Visible Panties. SELINA Im sorry I prohibit Viagra? Because what, because of my looks? Am I hideous? GARY Its just using those initials... SELINA Yes, to say that a chemical pill which guarantees to produce a strong, sustained erection in all men, whatever their age or medical history, is nullified by me. Dont searching that nickname again. ANNA No, of course. DAN So this would be where Senator Hallowes might meet lobbyists or constituents to discuss any issues they might have. CONSTITUENT She got rid of that emergency trailer park pretty quick. Those bastards wont be coming back. DAN Anna. ANNA Dan. DAN You look like youre on your way to somewhere important. DAN Honoured to meet you Madam Vice President. Im Dan Egan, Im with Senator Hallowes. SELINA Well tell her to put on her chemical suit, because Im coming over to see her. Anna, you want to....? CONSTITUENT Madam Vice President, great privilege to meet you. Can we talk to you about the Mexicans? SELINA Sure. Are my panties visible? GARY No maam. I havent seen them. Selina discretely checks her skirt. Dan takes Anna to one side. ANNA So, Dan, are you a tour guide now? If always knew youd make it to the top. DAN How was your bosss meeting? I hear the catering was a box of a dozen donuts. ANNA Fuck you. DAN I hadnt finished...and four of those were left over. ANNA I hadnt finished either...Fuck you Dan. You dick. OK, thats the small talk done. We know Hallowes is avoiding the Veep. C DAN Of course she is. Veep? ANNA Were pushing Veep as her acceptable nickname. DAN You mean instead of SheRa? ANNA We need 20 minutes with Senator Hallowes. DAN There are a lot of people who need 20 minutes with probably the next Chair of Finance. Take ticket number 89 and.. ANNA The Veeps thinking of offering the Senator a post on her Clean Jobs Commission. DAN After this plastics thing I think the Senator might prefer to attend something less contentious, like a Klan meeting. ANNA Come on Dan. Did what we had together mean nothing to you? DAN You know it didnt. ANNA You remember the restaurant. DAN Its my regular seconddate restaurant. Ladies and gentlemen. ANNA Its the SRVA Fundraiser tonight. ANNA How would you like to stand right next to the President? DAN She gets 10 minutes. SENATOR HALLOWES I still support him. It was an ill advised comment about offshore funds and, you know, Franks Chair of the Finance Committee so he needs to watch what he says... SENATOR HALLOWES But, look, weve all said dumb things in our lives and I dont think this is a resigning issue for Frank. Okay. Goodbye. DAN Now all that guy will take from the call will be the words dumb and resigning. CF SENATOR HALLOWES Thanks Dan. Selina! SELINA Hi Barbara. Youre not returning my calls. You been seeing another VP behind my back? DAN The Senator has been very busy with extremely important legislative business. SENATOR HALLOWES You must remember what that was like, Selina, from when you were a Senator? SELINA You shafting Frank to get Chair of Finance? I remember that from my Senate days. SENATOR HALLOWES Yep. Officially supporting hin, unofficially positioning to take over after his surefire resignation tomorrow afternoon. SELINA The usual dance. Gary, could you get me a coffee from the machine? GARY Oh, Ive managed to get a fresh batch of those European sweeteners you like so much. The French sweeteners? SELINA Thanks Gary. Youre phenomenal. Theyre great, great sweeteners. SELINA I dont like them especially, they taste just like any other sweetener. Sweet. Its not like wine, you dont say, mmn, sweetener Im getting oak, maybe a hint of raspberries and, my, is that fennel? No, its just a harsh chemical sweetener, but Gary puts so much effort into getting them I dont have the heart to tell the poor bastard. SENATOR HALLOWES So, I love what youre doing with the whole cutlery thing. DAN You got Google alerts on all the VPs nicknames? Mrs Doubtmeyer, you got that? ANNA Yes. DAN Thats a clever one, because it implies shes both nannying and confused. ANNA So Hallowes is going to get the Chair of the Finance Committee from Frank? DAN Probably. She wont be very good at it though. Theyll want Frank back. ANNA Okay. Indiscreet? DAN She wouldnt believe you over me so I can be honest. Senator Hallowes is mediocre. If they did greetings cards that said Youre basically adequate, thats what people would send her. SELINA Dan seems good. SENATOR HALLOWES Hes great. Very loyal. SENATOR HALLOWES Got him from an Ohio Congresswoman. She was clearly going nowhere. You know hes dating my daughter? SELINA Janet? SENATOR HALLOWES No. SELINA Sorry, of course not. I meant... Carol. Carol Hallowes. GARY I got you a double sleeve. Always err on the side of caution. And two sweeteners. SELINA So you saw my letter inviting you on to the Clean Jobs Commission? Its going to be big my stamp on this administration. SENATOR HALLOWES Yes, I saw the letter. Anna forges your signature brilliantly. SELINA She does it so well sometimes I think I use her version of my signature when I sign my own name. Which I did. So why are you avoiding me? SENATOR HALLOWES Isnt it obvious? SELINA You seriously think plastics will pull funding over this? SENATOR HALLOWES What is plastic made of, Selina? You piss ey off plastic, you piss off oil. And I do not want to fuck with those guys. Because they fuck in a very unpleasant fashion. SELINA Jesus, does everything in this town have to come down to money? Why cant we go back to the old days, when we just swapped land for beads? SENATOR HALLOWES Because, now wed be controlled by the bead industry. I need to get going. DAN Nice bag Gary. ANNA He calls it The Leviathan. DAN You got the nuclear codes in there? GARY Ha, yes, you see, what I have in here may seem trivial but it is far from trivial. He takes out two small tins. GARY See? Two types of lip salve one is ordinary, everyday, regular salve. But if the Veep is in too many airconditioned rooms her lips get radically dry, and she needs the heavyduty stuff. Without it, she cant talk. Literally, its too painful for her to speak words. DAN And I guess if she cant talk that could result in anything. Maybe war? GARY Very funny, Dan, but not so very far from the truth. I do a serious job. DAN And those guys who say youre just an old man holding a ladys purse screw them? ANNA Dan play nice. DAN Would you take a bullet for the VP? GARY Well, thats the security guys. My job would be to help her when shes down. Staunch the bleeding, get her painkillers and, you know... DAN Lip salve, right. In case she gets shot in the lips. ANNA Dan. Give me the ball. DAN But youre the one constantly by her side, so if someone were to shoot at her...you know... GARY Okay... DAN You ready for that? Hot, fast metal ripping your internal organs apart. It aint Shiatsu. SENATOR HALLOWES Oh, you know Senator Reeves died? SELINA Retard Reeves? He must have been...91? SENATOR HALLOWES SELINA He was the first Senator to welcome me to the Capitol. He was old even then. ANNA Was he full of wisdom? SELINA He was full of Bourbon and he touched my left boob. ANNA God rest his soul. SENATOR HALLOWES Did you fire your tweeting guy? Because he is a weaponsgrade retard. I think you might have been hoist by your own retard there! Selina laughs. Senator Hallowes marches off. Dan lingers a bit. DAN By the way, I really admired your campaign, sorry you didnt get the nomination. SELINA Thank you. I agree, I think we fought a good campaign. DAN Two things I would have done differently, but youve probably been over those with Anna. SELINA Two things? What were they? DAN Shouldnt have spent so much time in New Hampshire, that was in the bag, and attack ads in Oregon were four days too early, it looked like you were mean before you had to be. But look, Im teaching my grandmother to suck eggs here. Mother...big sister to suck eggs. SELINA Interesting. Good to meet you Dan. Selina and Gary head off. DAN See you at the fundraiser. ANNA Yup, dont forget your plus one. DAN Yup, plus one. ANNA So, did the Senator take the Clean Jobs post? SELINA What do you think of Dan? ANNA Dan is a shit. SELINA Okay, want to expand on that? ANNA Hes a massive and total shit. When you first meet him, you think, surely to God this man cant be as big a shit as he seems. But he is. SELINA See, I... ANNA Its like, if you were to see a book with covers made of shit, youd think, thats intriguing. I wonder whats in this book that they saw fit to give it covers made of pure shit. Then you open it and shit. SELINA I think hes OK. I think we could use him for...lets just say, I think Senator Hallowes has made herself a very powerful enemy. ANNA Who? SELINA Me! ANNA Yes, you. Of course. GARY Absolutely, you. SELINA Im the powerful enemy. ANNA Hey Mike off to give the 3:30? MIKE Yeah. I heard about the cutleryfuck at the Capitol. Thanks everyone. ANNA Yeah, go polish that turd, Mike. MIKE And the plastic guy what do you plan to say to him? SELINA Okay, well I guess my main... MIKE Actually, dont tell me. If I genuinely dont know, the bastards cant make me tell them. You know my motto: I Dont Want To Know And Anyway What Motto, I Have No Motto. SELINA Jonah. JONAH Madam Vice President. ANNA I know you only do that to look cool and get the giris. MIKE You look like the guy from My Left Foot. Selina goes through into her private office. JONAH The President lets me smoke out of the White House briefing room window, and that opens the whole way. GARY That ones an antisuicide window. JONAH They only put it in when you joined, right Gary? GARY No. ANNA How many times have you spoken to the President today, Jonah? You need to remember so you can put it up on your star chart on the refrigerator. JONAH Four times. In the briefing room, in the hallway, NSC meeting, in the hallway again. MIKE Is that as he was trying to throw you out of the NSC meeting? JONAH The President knows my name Mike. I doubt he remembers yours. ANNA You know he attaches an image to a name to make it easier to remember? So for you Jonah hed think of a whale, because youre called Jonah and you look like a whale. JONAH So, Anna, good new Italian place opened downtown. You like Italian? ANNA I love Italian Jonah. But still, unfortunately, really dislike you. JONAH Hey, Im not asking you out. That wasnt a knockback because I didnt ask you out. ANNA Jonah, you know I will never go out with you. I would rather go out with Gary than go out with you and I would never in a million years go out with Gary. Isnt that right, Gary? GARY Right. Youve said this many a time. SELINA Jonah, you are, I know, a very busy and important 24yearold. So why have you come to see us? JONAH The White House would like you to go to tonights SRVA fundraiser instead of the President. SELINA Why? JONAH Hed rather not be open to questioning tonight. Franks remarks about offshore accounts and curbing business tax breaks were obviously absolutely correct, but he will be resigning tomorrow. Pharmaceuticals and the Roundtable are flapping, we need to throw them a cuttlefish. SELINA Apt food metaphor, given theres no backbone involved. Sorry, Jonah, Id love to go up there and publicly contradict my beliefs, but I have my own agenda space to tend to. JONAH The President is very keen that your going to the fundraiser should be, fundamentally, the sequence of events that does actually take place this evening. Selina has no option. SELINA Let me make a cail. JONAH You need to be there too Mike, so no going home to walk the dog. Make sure the VP doesnt mention cornstarch, plastics, fossil fuels or any type of organic or inorganic compound whatsoever. MIKE Dont tell me what to do, Doogie fucking Howzer. JONAH I dont know what that means. Or the left foot thing. And I can fucking tell you what to do because one of us backed the winning candidate in the Presidential nominations. Let me text you the name of that someone who does now work for the President... and not for the candidate who lost. MIKE Jungle. JONAH Jonah. Its predictive text. You know what I wrote. I wrote my name. MIKE Okay Jungle. SELINA Right, Ive cancelled my date. Anna, we should get a speech and some jokes together. JONAH Jokes? SELINA Just some gags to liven things up. Anna will come up with some. ANNA Maybe not jokes as such. Maybe more a light touch. Like Ugly Betty its not technically a comedy, but it has a light touch. JONAH No, no jokes. These are not humorous times for America. Jonah leaves. SELINA You know, Im wondering just how hard Ill weep when that guy gets his embolism. ANNA Okay, lets turn this use tonights speech for your Reenergizing Floor Procedure agenda. SELINA Right. Lets float my idea about cloture change needing 41 to prevent instead of 60 to invoke. ANNA You dont seriously expect me to come up with jokes about that? Mike heads out. MIKE Ill go and check if the press rooms ready for the fireball about to hit them. SELINA Mike what were my two big campaign Mistakes, would you say? MIKE You looked tired a lot of the time? And that hat? SELINA You dont think one of them was that we went too soon with attack ads in Oregon? MIKE Who knows about that shit? Anyway, we got here in the end. ANNA Okay, Senator Clements is here, you should definitely talk to her. And Bill Knight from the Speakers office. MIKE Ooch, little burgers. Great. Four of those make a normal one. ANNA I assume youre taking some of those home for your dog? SELINA What utensils do they have here? I cant be seen using cornstarch over plastic. Or plastic over cornstarch. MIKE You could use celery as a kind of shovel? SELINA Bring me some lentil salad, I11 go in the corner and eat it with my fingers. GARY I expect this is a fairly lowrisk event, yeah? Allticket affair? WOMAN Pretty much. Theres usually one or two unknowns. GARY Unknowns? WOMAN You guys with Kate? The men nod. WOMAN Okay. Youre not terrorists are you, cos Kate knows a lot of terrorists! MIKE They deliberately dont give you a plate at these things to discourage you from getting a free dinner. But I always say the forearm is natures plate. MIKE By the way, Im Mike. SELINA Do you have my notes Anna? ANNA Gary has them. SELINA Notes please Gary. SELINA Gary? GARY Sorry maam do you need me? SELINA I need my notes. Why are you over there? MIKE Take a hike kid. LITTLE GIRL Im sorry sir? MIKE Take a hike. Defcon one. SELINA Distinguished ladies and gentlemen... and Tom! SELINA Aaahm. These are serious times. And in serious times we require an effective legislature. Im reminded tonight of the late Senator David Reeves... SELINA He died. Hes dead now. And I remember him talking to me about the absurdity of allowing multiple filibusters on a single bill. In his words... JONAH This isnt quite the Gettysburg Address. DAN Its more a recreation of the tragic events that led to it. ANNA Could you two shut your mouths? Its that red and yellow hole you use when you sieve carbohydrates through your pubey 15yearolds beard. JONAH Im sorry. Are you having difficulty hearing the other 200 people talking over your boss? JONAH That your date? DAN Thats the woman Im with tonight, yes. JONAH Shes nice. An eight. Definite eight. I used to get sixes, now Im in the White House I get eights. DAN Ive never seen you with an eight. JONAH Oh, I get eights, believe me. Im up to my neatly trimmed nuts in eights... DAN So, who do you know? ANNA Carol Hallowes? How do you even say that? Carol Hallowes. Hallo Carol Hallowes! DAN You know I did promise her shed be three feet away from the President tonight. ANNA What a shame shes going to have to be content with being, what? ...three and a half inches away from you later? DAN That doesnt work. As a joke. The penis, whatever size, is inserted into the vagina. So she would be the same distance from me if my penis were small or huge. ANNA Hallo Carol Hallowes! CUT TO: Selinas still speaking. SELINA With a Senate logjam like we currently have, hundreds of bills are getting stalled, which means millions... JONAH What are you doing? ANNA Im giving her the signal to make a joke. JONAH Dont, shes in enough trouble. ANNA Get your hand off me you freak! ANNA And dont tell people you got to first base with me, because that wasnt first base. That was assault. SELINA So, Ill let you all get back to enjoying yourselves. Actually talking of enjoyment, and leisure, I just booked a holiday in Florida. Wonder if that makes me the Miami Vice President!? Or... Okay, thank you for listening and... HECKLER You going to be tweeting about this? SELINA Ha! If thats a reference to the rogue cutlery tweet Im afraid that there we were very much hoist by our own retard! Thank you so much. SELINA Do people not listen any more? So rude. ANNA Maam...the last remark you made... DAN The word retard. SELINA Its not that bad a word, is it? ANNA It will be deemed offensive to anyone with learning difficulties. Yes maam. DAN This will soon be getting on the blogs. SELINA What? Shit how? I just said it like a second ago. Fuck broadband. ANNA Maam, the President of ATT is in the room. ANNA Mike, put the crabcakes down, we have a situation with the Vice President. MIKE A situation with the Vice President? GARY Oh God! Is she down? I should have been there! SELINA This is not my fault. DAN I cant access Kagans blog. Is it down? ANNA No, not your fault maam. I cant access Kagan either. Someone punch the ATT guy. SELINA This is your boss. She was using that word so much this morning retard this, retard the other it was like Hurricane Retard. It fixed it in my head. DAN Theres a way to mend this. Tomorrow morning you meet with someone amenable from a mental health charity. I have a lot of contacts. SELINA I imagine you probably do. Youre a hub. A nexus the size of Texas. Talk to Anna. ANNA Appreciate your input Dan but fuck off. She needs to call the Association of Mental Health Charities right now, not tomorrow, and apologise. DAN No! Calm things down. More haste, less speed. ANNA The way I see it, more haste, more haste. We need haste here. DAN Larry, Moe let Curly in first. SELINA Yes, thats right, so I was wanting to apologise over some comments that I...uh huh, sure, Ill hold. Im holding. Actually, what if they havent heard about it yet. What if the mental people havent heard the retard comments? ANNA Well, they will hear eventually so... SELINA You think theyll definitely hear? MIKE They might not hear. What if Tom Hanks dies? ANNA What? MIKE Just a forinstance what if Tom Hanks dies? Thats all that will be on the news for like a week. SELINA Hes right, they1l be going with the cutlery thing tomorrow. Plastics is worse than retard. I think its worse. Is it? Fuck, I dont know any more. Should I hang up? MIKE Okay, how about we let the retard thing blow up. It was a silly word, we apologise, but its the main story, so weve drowned out plastics? ANNA Mike, the press didnt stop writing about Hiroshima just because the Nagasaki thing blew up. GARY Codeine or Ibuprofen? SELINA Both. Plus that stuff they use in lethal injections. Yes, hi, just one second... Theyve deheld me, Im loose, Ive gone rogue. What do I say? SELINA Yes, hi, I was mentioning to your colleague, what happened was I used the word retard in a...retard, yes. In a humorous context. No, I know, that is why Im apologising now.... ANNA I think were going to need you to puil an allnighter on this Mike. MIKE I cant. The dog. SELINA Go home. Feed the dog. Walk the dog. Shoot the dog. Bury the dog. Come back in. MIKE Actually, maybe...the dog will be fine. MIKE It was a reference to a petard. No, not Star Trek petard. ANNA Okay, set up new Google alerts for VP. Meyer offensive, Meyer retard, Meyer resigning issue. Then delete your History. JONAH Okay, why the huge retard panic? The retard things not as bad as cutlery. ANNA The Veep apologised last night about the retard thing. JONAH What? She put it out there? Okay, heres a couple more News Alerts for you then: try VP worse than the Jonestown massacre and VP 911 point 2. ANNA I havent got time to ignore you Jonah. Gary, could you ignore Jonah for me? GARY I assume youre joking Anna. Hi Jonah. What do you have there? JONAH Condolence card, for Senator Reeves widow. The Presidents already signed, so if Selina could too, while she still has a job? Then I11l send it round the Hill. DAN Anna, this is Paul Burton, Chair of the American Association of Mental Health Charities. PAUL Hi. SELINA Mr Burton. Why dont you come through to my office. Gary, could you fix some coffee? GARY Yes maam. JONAH Maam, I have a condolence card here for Senator Reeves widow... ANNA What was that gesture? Ive never seen her give that gesture. JONAH Is she not going to sign this card? ANNA Ill sign the card. Thats what her gesture was to me, to do her signature on this. What was her gesture to you Dan? DAN Im not sure I noticed a gesture. ANNA Can you not stand so close Jonah, you stink of cigarettes. JONAH I smell like a man. All men used to smell like this. Spencer Tracy used to smell like this. Cary Grant. I smell like them. DAN Dead old men. Gary emerges from Selinas office. JONAH You all smell of women, especially you Gary. GARY Thatll be the VPs scented wipes. Vanilla and rose. ANNA I know what youre doing Dan, okay? DAN Yes? What am I doing? ANNA I dont know, exactly, but I do know that you are one sly fuck. You know Fantastic Mr Fox? Thats you, only youre worse than a fox. Youre Fantastic Mr Shit. JONAH Sorry to interrupt the prenup, but is this card going to...? ANNA Im signing the fucking card. MIKE Hit the deck, fuckers! Brett Kagans blog is now saying the VP was calling Senator Reeves a retard at the fundraiser. DAN Well, see, thats Kagan getting things completely wrong. We can prove the VP didnt say that and discredit him. Which is why I planted that story with him in the first place. ANNA MIKE What the fuck...? DAN Its a dumb story anyway, and we also show its unreliable, because it comes from a blogger whos a news slut. He shuts down, cutlery moves to page 10, retard moves to page 5,and on page 1 we have Bloggers Eat Babies. GARY I dont understand. Are you meant to be clever? DAN Its brilliant Gary. And it gets better. What you need to do, Mikey, at the 11:30 press call today is make it clear there were two people the VP and Senator Hallowes involved in Retardgate. GARY Can we not call it Retardgate? Can we call it the Rword Fup? DAN I dont give a splayed fucking anus what the fuck we call it you clumsy fucking human tumour, weve got to deal with it, okay? Now get on board, or I swear Ill slice your tits off so Mike can take them home for his dog. We need a body. And we cant give them the Vice President. MIKE So we give them your boss? Are you doing a thing, a clever double thing, or...? DAN Dont worry your meaty head, Mike, just tell the press that Senator Hallowes introduced the expression retard into the conversation. And she encouraged strike she goaded the VP into using it. MIKE You think Im going to do what you say? Dan gets very close to Mike. DAN Ask yourself do you think I1l end up working in a position above you or below you Mike? Every shred of ambition left your body a long time ago and all youve got left for the remaining 10 years of your working life is a damp apartment, cold dwarfburgers from a buffet, and an invisible fucking dog. Make a calculation. GARY Oh, could you sign this customs form to confirm that Selinas French sweeteners werent a gift? Not, if you will, a sweetener. ANNA You, Gary, are as funny as...fuck. GARY Why thank you. ANNA No. Fuck. The condolence card. I think I signed my own name. Not Selinas, mine. GARY How sure are you, on a scale of one to ten, where one... ANNA I can work out how the fucking scale will go Gary. Nine. Im nine sure that I signed my name. GARY Nine. Thats almost the full ten. ANNA Okay. Not good. The VP couldnt be bothered to sign a card for one of the most revered Senators of the last 50 years. Selina cant know about this. GARY No. ANNA Gary...! GARY If shes going down, Ive got to catch her. ANNA Why did you tell her? You lunatic. Shes going to turn into an apeshit crazy person. SELINA SELINA This is insane. Weve done Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Were doing Chernobyl as well? ANNA Im so sorry. I .. SELINA I need every Senator on side to get reform through and you give me this? Senators are fucking prickly people, Anna. I know. I used to be a big fucking prickly Senator. ANNA Im so sorry. Well get the card back. SELINA Yes you will. Now get on with it, because Im busy in there apologising. SELINA Sorry, how where... ANNA Mike, a truckload of fuck has just been unloaded all over this office. MIKE Man, this is too much information. MIKE I need you to know Im not happy about giving this briefing. DAN And I need you to know that I couldnt give a shit. MIKE Is this going to be like Moonlighting where we end up falling in love with each other and fucking? DAN No, more like The Wire, where I end up blowing your brains out. And then like Dexter, where I cut you into little pieces and incinerate you. And then like The West Wing, where I become President. GARY Im feeling a bit like, you know, the Watergate burglars? I mean, this is... ANNA Dont be a dick Gary. With Watergate they burgled party secrets, youre retrieving a greetings card. OK? They forced illegal entry, you have a pass that authorises you to enter most of the White House. SELINA This isnt Watergate. This is walking through a gate. GARY I need a long coat. To hide the card. ANNA You can borrow mine. SELINA Good luck Gary take that bullet for me! JONAH Gary. GARY Jesus! Jonah! Hi. JONAH Youre in my office. GARY Yes. JONAH What do you want? In my office. GARY Nothing at all. Just...I needed to see... JONAH Are you here to steal the card, Gary? GARY No sir, not at all. JONAH This looks bad Gary. This looks real bad. And Im a friend of yours. GARY But it isnt bad. Im not bad. JONAH I knew the card had been incorrectly signed. But I didnt say anything because I wanted to use this knowledge for my personal advantage. GARY Right. JONAH I will give you the card Gary. With pleasure. GARY Thank you. Please get to the bad bit of this because I know therell be one and I dont like tension. I have acid reflux issues. JONAH I want Anna to go on a date with me tonight. We wont have sex, because she hates me. But Anna is an eight, and if the other eights I want to have sex with see Im eightcapable, then I will have some sex with an eight before too long. GARY Im sorry, but do I look like a pimp? JONAH You kind of do. DAN Weve all said dumb things in our lives. But I certainly dont think this is a resigning issue for Senator Hallowes. Okay. Goodbye. Hi, Carol Hallowes please. O Carol Hallowes. Yes, voicemail, thanks. Carol, its Dan. I dont really know how to say this... .but I dont think, right now, Im ready to take that next step that we need to take as a couple ... ..l mean, really, this is killing me, this decision. Jesus. Im not eating... ...its tearing me up. Plus, you have a stupid fucking name. DAN Hey, big guy. Looks like Operation Terrified Old Man went well. GARY Jonah caught me. I had to make a deal. ANNA No she fucking isnt. GARY He doesnt want to sleep with you, just dinner and a movie. DAN A date with stinky Jonah. Lucky you. Youre getting him in his prime, before next years heartlung transplant. ANNA Im not going out with Jonah. SELINA Get a grip. Its one date with no sex. For me that was 12 years of marriage. Okay, let me sign this thing. This has gone from being a resigning issue, to a resigning issue. Thats a very clever orthographic joke. SELINA Shit. ANNA Shit. SELINA The President already signed. We need to forge the Presidents signature as well. GARY Isnt that still a capital offence? Cant you be electrocuted for that? DAN Ill do it. The key is to do it upside down. SELINA Wow. Dan thank you. Is there anything you cant do? C ANNA Foreplay. Empathy. DAN Oh, and Senator Hallowes has let it be known that she will not be putting her name forward to replace the Chair of the Finance Committee. SELINA Whos the baadass? Gary? GARY You are, Madam Vice President. DAN She also added shell be taking a less public role in future. So... ANNA Checking the mirror. DAN I guess that leaves me with a fatally injured boss. ANNA Signalling. DAN And I wondered if there might be a position in this office? ANNA And were moving off. Careful, you hit a toddler. SELINA We should talk. I was thinking Id like to create a Special Director of Communications role within this department. DAN Uhhuh? Interesting. ANNA Excuse me you just hired him? You hired the biggest bastard in DC? SELINA Im fluent in bastard. Its one of my languages. Dont worry about me. ANNA You? Im worried about me. Ive worked for you for nine years. I have... SELINA And I havent done anything for you? You happen to be standing in the office of the Vice President of the United States young lady. I think thats pretty good. ANNA Young lady? SELINA I used Dan to get what I wanted. ANNA No, he used you to get what he wanted. SELINA No, I definitely used him. Im the user, hes the usee. Thats right, isnt it? ANNA Does he look used? DAN Nice desk, Gary. MIKE Duck and cover, everyone. This is the front page of tomorrows Post. JONAH I just saw that nice teeth. Madam Vice President, youll be relieved to hear the President has decided to subsume the Clean Jobs Commission into the DOE... SELINA Hes done what?! JONAH .thus leaving you free to apply your unique talents to other fields of interest. SELINA Such as? JONAH The Mars Project? SELINA Great, that sounds like something achievable in the next month. Get the fuck out of here, little boy, before I confiscate your prostate. JONAH Come on then Anna, shrimp linguine and a porno. Im joking. Its chicken linguine. Anna and Jonah leave. ANNA Touch me at this restaurant and you will get metal cutlery in your eyes. SELINA You know Mike whod have thought that if you Tweet about cutlery and call a dead senator a retard, its the cutlery that comes to bite you? MIKE Reeves was a retard anyway. SELINA Yep. And, at least four times in his distinguished Senate career, a rapist. ANNA Sorry maam, forgot to brief you. This is Ken Nichol of the Plastics Cellulose Association. Id booked him in for a four oclock. SELINA Mr Nichol. Gary! Coffee! And two fucking sugars. \n"

JENNA Hi, let me explain that Im really hung over right now and thats why I look like this. But Im not normally hung over on a Wednesday. I tried a new tapas restaurant in my neighborhood last night and the waiter recognized me so he kept giving me free mojitos which doesnt happen all the time, Im not like, some gross famous person but he kept bringing them and I dont usually drink hard liquor cause Im really small and I can get drunk so easily I mean, I dont get drunk frequently. JENNA Im just saying that if I look a little green there are extenuating circumstances. KENNETH How about that? Jenna DeCarlo, every JENNA But I dont want people to think Im not friendly. Im just nauseous and I have stomach issues JENNA Okay. JENNA Forget I said stomach issues. Okay. Bye. PETE Im surprised youre renovating. This is such a nice office. JACK Its a great office. But sometimes you have to change things that are perfectly good just to make them your own. JACK call her back. Is she at the White House number? JACK Tell them I need a 4 a.m. tee time. JACK About five inches, but its thick. JACK Are you familiar with the awardwinning GE Trivection oven? LISA I dont cook very much, JACK Sure. I got you. New York third wave feminist. Collegeeducated. Single and pretending to be happy about it. Over scheduled, undersexed. You buy any magazine that says healthy body image on the cover, but your kitchens got nothing but Snackwells and expired yogurts. You reject traditional female roles, but every two years you take up knitting for a week. PETE Thats dead on. LISA Are you gonna guess my weight now? JACK You dont want me to do that. PETE That knitting thing is just uncanny. How do you do that? JACK Market research, my friend. Years and years of market research... that lead to my greatest triumph, the Trivection oven. PETE My wife wants one of those. JACK Yes, but Iil need my kevlar vest. The Trivection oven cooks perfect food five times faster than a conventional even, because it uses three kinds of heat: thermal technology, for consistent temperature GE Precise Air convection technology, for optimal air circulation and microwave technology, for unbelievable speed. With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey in 22 minutes. PETE Wow. Thats impressive. JACK The people upstairs agree. Thats why they promoted me. Thats why Im here to retool your show. LISA Retool what now? JACK Im the new Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming. LISA That sounds like you program microwave ovens. JACK See, I told you that was imprecise. Make it Vice President of East Coast Television Programming and Microwave Oven LISA Czar? JACK I like you. You have the boldness of a much younger woman. PETE You know, Jack, Lisa and I have worked together on a bunch of shows over the last ten years, and I know Gary was very pleased JACK Pete, Ive seen the show. The littie gals good. LISA Jenna. JACK And the skits are decent, but youre missing that third kind of heat. LISA Theres the kind of heat that rises from dog poop. Maybe we could use that. JACK Think about Lawrence Jordan. PETE The black guy? JACK The black movie star. I flew with him recently on a private jet to the Super Bowl, and he was very entertaining. LISA Isnt he, um... crazy? JACK Lawrence has had his problems in the last few years. LAWRENCE I am a jedi! I ama jedi! JACK But its important to remember that he was never charged with any crime. Its not illegal to fall asleep on your neighbors roof. PETE Nor should it be. JACK Lawrence Jordan is the third heat. PETE So would he join the cast...? s JACK Join the cast, permanent guest host Im going to meet with him this afternoon and see what he thinks JACK What are you doing? LISA Sometimes when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it. LISA This is not a dream. JACK Jonathan, take Pete and help him pick out a Trivection oven for his wife. PETE Hey. LISA Wait. LISA We also want a coffee machine, a snack basket JACK Done. Jonathan? JACK Lisa, Ive heard a lot of good things about you, LISA Well, a lot of that stuff I dont do anymore. JACK I just want you to know that your job is secure. Youre gonna be essential to transforming the show. LISA No, no, no, Jack. Jenna is my friend and we like our show the way it is. It may not get the highest ratings, but we have our own little following, and Im not going to let you come in here and turn it into some kind of JACK Hit? LISA Just let me talk to her before you make any concrete LISA Mothereffer! JOSH Yes, I have an appointment with Louise. JENNA Glouise isnt here. Im Bevergly. JENNA And Ill be your substitute hair styglist! IOOFER We should do one where Bevergly is a grape counselor. JOSH Just tell me who your parents are. SARIE No. You couldnt handle it. JOSH Okay, Im gonna try to guess who they are from looking at your face. JOSH Blond hair, little nose, kind of Swedish... Your mom is... Cheryl Tiegs and your dad is... Stephen Hawking. Sarie punches him in the arm. JOSH What? Cause youre smart! PETE ...and Jenna DeCarlo was very upset. KENNETH I tried to read her face, but its so rubbery! PETE How bout this? As a rule, if you see a celebrity when youre with the tour group, do not bother them. KENNETH Is that a quideline, or a rule? Cause I respond well to structure. PETE Lets say its a rule. LISA Hey. JENNA Hey. What happened to your head? LISA The sky is falling. Do you have a minute? JENNA No. I have a costume fitting for the Judgemental Baby sketch. LISA Ahh. I11 find you after. JENNA You seem upset. LISA You seem upset. JENNA Im hung over. LISA Remember, like, five years ago when you were still waitressing and I was temping at that law firm and we used to do improv shows for free at night? JENNA Yeah. LISA Did we hate it? JENNA Yeah. We hated it a lot. LISA Thats what I thought. TOOFER Well done, m lady! FRANK Howd you get everything so fast? LISA What can I say? Im a hardass. PETE Well, my condolences. Please let me know where we can send flowers. Okay. PETE Ugh, poor Gary. LISA How did he die? PETE Killed by a deer. LISA What? PETE He used to feed the deer every morning at his house upstate. And then he got an injunction from the township saying he had to stop. So he did. Two days later, he goes out to get his paper, and the deer go mad. LISA They just went mad? PETE He stopped feeding them and they turned on him. LISA What are we gonna do? We quit, right? Do we quit? PETE Not me. My twins need braces. f LISA The older twins or the identicals? PETE All four. Theyve got mouths like piranhas. He hands her a picture from his desk. LISA Ew. They do. PETE But sometimes with a thing like this, if you wait it out, it goes away on its own. LISA No, you gotta get the braces. PETE Jack Donaghy, Im talking about. So he meets with crazy Lawrence Jordan today. Jordan11 ask for too much money or hell show up wearing a childs swimsuit and a shower cap and Donaghy will change his mind. Nobody needs to know this ever came up. Josh enters. JOSH Oh, hey, awesome. Just the people I was looking for. Im working on this bit about celebrities doing commercials, like This is Christopher Walken for Tropicana orange juice. Try the juice. Its very... tangy Or, um Yo, this is Lawrence Jordan, star of Black CopWhite. Cop and when I want a good nights sleep, I sleep on my neighbors roof. But now that Im making a comeback, I sleep at the Best Western. Best Western. Its like sleeping on Ted Dansons roof. Holla! LISA Okay, I dont know what youve heard, but Lawrence Jordan is not joining the cast. He is not taking over for Jenna. We are not turning into The Lawrence Jordan Show. JOSH What? LISA Nothing. PETE Nicely handled. KENNETH Yes, Katie Couric is real tiny in person. KENNETH But her boobs are a lot bigger than you would think. KENNETH Now, if yall look over here, youll see a water fountain! KENNETH Does anyone have any questions about it? Lawrence gives his posse a look like, What the heli? Why isnt this guy acknowledging me? LAWRENCE Yes, I have a question. How do you feel, NBC Tour? Cause you look like a portay! KENNETH Lawrence Jordan, everybody. LAWRENCE Youre beautiful, little Mama. Youre doing Gods work. Dont I know you from the insurance meeting? Weve got to sign those papers, Reginald. LAWRENCE Listen. I know being your age is hard. But dont you put on the trench coat. You hear me? You have a problem, you call me. Dont put on that trench coat. LAWRENCE Live. Life. Love. Laugh! JOSH Does Jenna know? LISA I gotta tell her before she hears it somewhere else. JOSH Shes been around the block. She can handle bad news. LISA Yeah... Off Lisas look... JENNA I said wheat toast. She bursts into tears. LISA Shes gonna freak out. TOOFER I will not work with Lawrence Jordan. PETE Its just a rumor. TOOFER I worked with him at the MTV awards two years ago, where he found it endlessly amusing to show me his johnson. PETE How was it? TOOFER Considerable. On one cccasion, he had placed it in a footlong hot dog bun and put mustard on it. I loathe him. SARIE Hes not that bad. He rents near us in East Hampton. I saw him once at a charity polo match. PETE Did he seem crazy? SARIE No. Well... he was making out with Martha Stewart...but weve all done that. Joking. TOOFER Have you seen any of his movies? The guys sensibility is just cretinous. LISA I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters. TOOFER Black CopWhite Cop LISA No. JOSH Who Dat Ninja? LISA No, he was... god, they all blend together, dont they? He had to pretend to be an old lady TOOFER Yes, yes. He actually says the title at one point... Off their thinking... LAWRENCE Oh, gracious goodness! You hooligans better watch out! LAWRENCE Cause this honky arandma be trippin! LISATOOFER Honky Grandma Be Trippin. JOSH Oh, yeah. That movie was hilarious. FRANK Is what I heard true?! PETE No! FRANK Gary Luderman got killed by a deer?! PETE Oh yeah, by the way, everybody. Gary Luderman got killed by a deer. JENNA You guys, you have to come see this! You know that crazy actor guy from Who Dat Ninja? Hes in our studio! Its hilarious! You have to see it. LAWRENCE Im back, America! Im coming into your house. LAWRENCE Im coming into your house, America! JACK We love you, Lawrence! Come into our homes? LAWRENCE Im the third heat! Im the third heat! JACK Youre the third heat, baby! JENNA This guys fulltilt nuts. Am I right? KENNETH Here we see the set for Friday Night Bits. JENNA What did he say? LISA Jenna, I have some news. Dont freak out. JENNA I am a jedi! I am a jedi! LAWRENCE JORDAN Now at the time, me and Eddie were both talking to the same girl, cept I didnt know she was a transexual... Everyone laughs. LISA Will not one of you stand with me? LISA Would you like me to review for you everything youve done wrong so far? Youve hired a guy so crazy that nobody else in the world will work with him right now. You brought him in here without even talking to Jenna first, which will send her into a twoyear spiral. Youre putting him in my hands, knowing I dont want him here. You gave my greedy, insatiable writing staff every toy they asked for, which only means they will have a longer list of things they want tomorrow. Dont stop feeding those deer, Mr. Donaghy, or they will turn on you. JACK Youll make it work. LISA What makes you think that? JACK Cause your friend Jennas got nowhere else to go. Youll be nice to Lawrence, cause its not his fault. And youll focus all your rage and hatred on me. LISA Ugh, you know what? You dont know everything about me. JACK About 127 pounds. LISA Hi, Im Lisa. Im LAWRENCE Yes, yes. Lisa Lemon! I know who you are. LAWRENCE The very talented. Very talented. LISA Oh, well. Lets not. LAWRENCE Youre gonna be my Phil Spector, right? LISA Hows that? LAWRENCE Youre gonna take my raw black sound and make it nice for white peoples ears. LISA Yes. And then Im gonna kill somebody. Lawrence thinks this is hilarious. LISA Hi, Im here to pick up my baby. JENNA Tadeo, another mojito! LISA No, no. Come on, friend. Can I borrow this for five minutes? JENNA I have so much rage. LISA It could be worse. You could have nipple confusion. ']"
